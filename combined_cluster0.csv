"(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)(Applause ends)Hi, everyone. I'm Sirena. I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut. (Audience cheers)(Applause)Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here.(Laughter)I mean, what does this have to do with technology, entertainment and design? Well, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology, but this has nothing to do with that.So I did a little research on it. Well, this is what I found. Of course, I hope I can memorize it.(Clears throat)The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings. By pulling a string, it vibrates and produces a sound wave, which passes through a piece of wood called a bridge, and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified, but ... let me think.(Laughter)Placing your finger at different places on the fingerboard changes the string length, and that changes the frequency of the sound wave. (Sighs) Oh, my gosh!(Laughter)OK, this is sort of technology, but I can call it a 16th-century technology. But actually, the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound. Isn't that cool?(Laughter)(Applause)Design — I love its design. I remember when I was little, my mom asked me, ""Would you like to play the violin or the piano?"" I looked at that giant monster and said to myself — ""I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day!""(Laughter)This is small and lightweight. I can play from standing, sitting or walking. And, you know what? The best of all is that if I don't want to practice, (Whispering) I can hide it.(Laughter)The violin is very beautiful. Some people relate it as the shape of a lady. But whether you like it or not, it's been so for more than 400 years, unlike modern stuff [that] easily looks dated. But I think it's very personal and unique that, although each violin looks pretty similar, no two violins sound the same — even from the same maker or based on the same model.Entertainment — I love the entertainment. But actually, the instrument itself isn't very entertaining. I mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it, it was actually really bad, because it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids — it was so horrible and so scratchy. So, it wasn't entertaining at all. But besides, my brother found this very funny: Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!(Laughter)A few years later, I heard a joke about the greatest violinist, Jascha Heifetz. After Mr. Heifetz's concert, a lady came over and complimented him: ""Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin sounded so great tonight!"" And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person, so he picked up his violin and said, ""Funny — I don't hear anything.""(Laughter)Now I realize that as the musician, we human beings, with our great mind, artistic heart and skill, can change this 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment. Now I know why I'm here.(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)At first, I thought I was just going to be here to perform, but unexpectedly, I learned and enjoyed much more. But ... although some of the talks were quite up there for me.(Laughter)Like the multi-dimension stuff. I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough if I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school.(Laughter)But actually, the most impressive thing to me is that — well, actually, I would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults, for actually caring for us a lot, and to make our future world much better. Thank you.(Applause)(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)(Applause ends)(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/sirena_huang_dazzles_on_violin

"(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)Thank you!(Applause continues)Thank you very much. Like the speaker before me — I am a TED virgin, I guess. I'm also the first time here, and ...(Laughter)I don't know what to say!(Applause)I'm really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me. I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone. And the song that I just played was by Josef Hofmann. It's called ""Kaleidoscope."" And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century, and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time.I have another piece that I'd like to play for you. It's called ""Abegg Variations,"" by Robert Schumann, a German 19th-century composer. The name ""Abegg"" is actually A-B-E-G-G, and that's the main theme in the melody. (Plays the notes A, B, E, G and G) That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends.(Laughter)But he wrote that for his wife.(Laughter)So actually, if you listen carefully, there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme. It's written around 1834, so even though it's old, I hope you'll like it.(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)Now comes the part that I hate. Well, because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called ""Sync and Flow,"" I was wondering, ""What do I know that these geniuses don't?""(Laughter)So, I'll talk about musical composition, even though I don't know where to start.How do I compose? I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose. What I do first is, I make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano — and I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody, like the Abegg that you just heard. And once I choose my main theme, I have to decide: Out of all the styles in music, what kind of style do I want? And this year, I composed a Romantic style. So for inspiration, I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers.Next, I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers. They help me plan out the whole piece. And then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas, because then you have to think.(Laughter)And then, when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form — solidified, excuse me — solidified form, you're supposed to actually polish the piece, polish the details, and then polish the overall performance of the composition.And another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing. Drawing, because I like to draw, you know, Japanese anime art. I think that's a craze among teens right now. And once I realized it, there's a parallel between creating music and creating art, because for your motive, or your little initial idea for your drawing, it's your character — you want to decide who you want to draw, or if you want to draw an original character. And then you want to decide: How are you going to draw the character? Like, am I going to use one page? Am I going to draw it on the computer? Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book? For a more grandiose effect, I guess. And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character, which is like your structure of a piece, and then you add pen and pencil, and whatever details that you need — that's polishing the drawing.And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind, because I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted. So if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it, I'll try to draw or, you know, waste my time. And then what happens is, sometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at all, and then it's like there's too much on your mind. You can't focus on what you're supposed to do. And sometimes, if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it, you'll get something out of it, but it doesn't come naturally.What happens is, if something magical happens, if something natural happens to you, you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly, and then that's what I consider ""flow,"" because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything. You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want.I'm not going to play my own composition today because, although I did finish it, it's way too long. Instead, I'd like to try something called ""improvisation."" I have here seven note cards, one with each note of the musical alphabet. And I'd like someone to come up here and choose five — anyone to come up here and choose five — and then I can make it into some sort of melody, and I'll improvise it. Wow. A volunteer, yay!(Laughter)(Applause)Jennifer Lin: Nice to meet you.Goldie Hawn: Thank you. Choose five?JL: Yes, five cards. Any five cards.GH: OK, one. JL: OK.GH: Two. JL: Yes.GH: Three.GH: Oh, D and F — too familiar.(Laughter)JL: One more. GH: OK. ""E"" for ""effort.""JL: Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them?GH: OK — C, G, B, A and E.JL: Thank you very much!GH: You're welcome. And what about these?JL: I won't use them. Thank you!(Applause)Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E. I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order.(Plays notes)OK, that's nice. So, I'm going to have a moment to think, and I'll try to make something out of it.(Plays the five notes)(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)The next song, or the encore that I'm going to play is called ""Bumble Boogie,"" by Jack Fina.(Applause)(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_lin_improvs_piano_magic

"Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories, only to find out that you're a performance artist.(Laughter)I'm also a software engineer, and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer. And I think the main thing that I'm interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression. And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft, and in a way those are my bane: I think there's a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about what's possible on the computer. Of course, it's also a great liberating force that makes possible, you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on. But, in a way, the computer makes possible much more than what most people think, and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer, and so I end up writing software to do that.Chris has asked me to do a short performance, and so I'm going to take just this time — maybe 10 minutes — to do that, and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form.Thank you.(Applause)We've got about a minute left. I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project. I did a performance with two singers who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths. And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica; we repeated it in England. And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large screen. We used a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they were. And since we know where their heads are, and we have a wireless mic on them that we're processing the sound from, we're able to create visualizations which are linked very tightly to what they're doing with their speech. This will take about 30 seconds or so. He's making a, kind of, cheek-flapping sound.Well, suffice it to say it's not all like that, but that's part of it.Thanks very much. There's always lots more. I'm overtime, so I just wanted to say you can, if you're in New York, you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week, and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea. And with that, I think I should give up the stage, so, thank you so much.","https://www.ted.com/talks/golan_levin_on_software_as_art

And I went to the IT guys here and a gentleman mended my computer, and then he said, ""What are you doing here?"" and I said ""I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing,"" and he said, ""Oh, I sort of play the cello as well."" And I said, ""Do you really?"" Anyway, so you're in for a treat, because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark.(Applause)I am also joined by my partner in crime, Thomas Dolby.(Applause)This song is called ""Farther than the Sun.""(Music)♫ Strung in the wind I called you ♫♫ but you did not hear ... ♫♫ And you're a plant that needs poor soil ♫♫ and I have treated you too well ♫♫ to give up flowers ... ♫♫ Oh, I have been too rich for you ... ♫♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ You are not worthy ... ♫♫ With your calculating eyes ♫♫ spinning figures ♫♫ you cannot see me ♫♫ You cannot see me ... ♫♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫♫ I'll believe it ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ The sea, it freezes over ... ♫♫ to trap the light ♫♫ And I'm in love with being in love ♫♫ and you were never quite the one ♫♫ In Gerda's eyes ♫♫ Fragments of what you've become ♫♫ And all the moths that fly at night ♫♫ believe electric light is bright ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ With your calculating eyes ♫♫ Spinning figures ♫♫ You cannot see me, no ♫♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫♫ I'll believe it ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ With your calculating eyes ♫♫ Spinning figures ♫♫ You cannot see me, no ... ♫♫ And if I tell myself enough, I'll believe it ♫(Applause)Thank you very much.","https://www.ted.com/talks/caroline_lavelle_casts_a_spell_on_cello

"I'm not quite sure whether I really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning.(Laughter)But anyway, it's just great to see such a full theater, and really, I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation.(Applause)One of the interesting things, of course, is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology, and what he said about listening to our young people.Of course, my job is all about listening. And my aim, really, is to teach the world to listen. That's my only real aim in life. And it sounds quite simple, but actually, it's quite a big, big job. Because you know, when you look at a piece of music, for example, if I just open my little motorbike bag — we have here, hopefully, a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page. And, you know, we open it up ... And I read the music. So technically, I can actually read this. I will follow the instructions, the tempo markings, the dynamics. I will do exactly as I'm told. And so therefore, because time is short, if I just played you, literally, the first, maybe, two lines or so — It's very straightforward; there's nothing too difficult about the piece. But here, I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick. I'm being told where to play on the drum. I'm being told which part of the stick to use. And I'm being told the dynamic. And I'm also being told that the drum is without snares. Snares on, snares off. So therefore, if I translate this piece of music, we have this idea.(Drum sounds)(Drum sounds end)And so on. My career would probably last about five years.(Laughter)However, what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music; everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher, or to talk about, even, from a teacher. But it's the things you notice when you're not actually with your instrument that, in fact, become so interesting, and that you want to explore through this tiny, tiny surface of a drum. So there, we experience the translation. Now we'll experience the interpretation.(Drum sounds)(Drum sounds end)(Applause)Now my career may last a little longer.(Laughter)But in a way, you know, it's the same if I look at you and I see a nice, bright young lady with a pink top on. I see that you're clutching a teddy bear, etc., etc. So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about, what you might like, what you might do as a profession, etc., etc. However, that's just the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look and we try to interpret. But actually it's so unbelievably shallow. In the same way, I look at the music; I get a basic idea; I wonder what technically might be hard, or, you know, what I want to do. Just the basic feeling.However, that is simply not enough. And I think what Herbie said: please listen, listen. We have to listen to ourselves, first of all. If I play, for example, holding the stick — where literally I do not let go of the stick —(Drum sound)you'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm. And you feel really quite — believe it or not — detached from the instrument and from the stick, even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly.(Drum sound)By holding it tightly, I feel strangely more detached. If I just simply let go and allow my hand, my arm, to be more of a support system, suddenly —(Drum sound)I have more dynamic with less effort. Much more —(Drum sound)and I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum. And I'm doing far, far less.So in the same way that I need time with this instrument, I need time with people in order to interpret them. Not just translate them, but interpret them. If, for example, I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician — that is, someone who is basically a percussion player —(Marimba sounds)(Marimba sounds end)And so on, if I think of myself as a musician —(Marimba sounds)(Marimba sounds end)And so on. There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just —(Applause)thinking about.And I remember when I was 12 years old, and I started playing timpani and percussion, and my teacher said, ""Well, how are we going to do this? You know, music is about listening."" And I said, ""Yes, I agree with that, so what's the problem?"" And he said, ""Well, how are you going to hear this? How are you going to hear that?"" And I said, ""Well, how do you hear it?"" He said, ""Well, I think I hear it through here."" And I said, ""Well, I think I do too, but I also hear it through my hands, through my arms, cheekbones, my scalp, my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on.""And so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums, in particular, the kettle drums, or timpani to such a narrow pitch interval, so something like —(Marimba sounds)that of a difference. Then gradually:(Marimba sounds)And gradually:(Marimba sounds)And it's amazing that when you do open your body up, and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through, that in fact the tiny, tiny difference —(Marimba sounds)can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger, there.And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room, and together, we would ""listen"" to the sounds of the instruments, and really try to connect with those sounds far, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear. Because of course, the ear is subject to all sorts of things. The room we happen to be in, the amplification, the quality of the instrument, the type of sticks —(Marimba sounds)(Marimba sounds end)Etc., etc., they're all different.(Marimba sounds)(Marimba sounds end)Same amount of weight, but different sound colors. And that's basically what we are; we're just human beings, but we all have our own little sound colors, as it were, that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things.And as I grew older, I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London, and they said, ""Well, no, we won't accept you, because we haven't a clue, you know, of the future of a so-called 'deaf musician.'"" And I just couldn't quite accept that. And so therefore, I said to them, ""Well, look, if you refuse — if you refuse me through those reasons, as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound — then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept."" And as a result, once we got over a little hurdle, and having to audition twice, they accepted me. And not only that, what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom.Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms, no legs — they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand. No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry. And every single entry had to be listened to, experienced, and then, based on the musical ability, then that person could either enter or not. And so therefore, this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions, and I have to say, many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world. The interesting thing about this as well, though —(Applause)is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound — which is basically all of us — we well know that music really is our daily medicine.I say ""music,"" but actually I mean ""sound."" Because some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician — when you may have a 15-year-old lad who has got the most incredible challenges, who may not be able to control his movements, who may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. — suddenly, if that young lad sits close to this instrument, and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba, and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like, almost — I don't really have the right sticks, perhaps — but something like this — let me change —(Soft marimba sounds)(Soft marimba sounds end)Something that's so unbelievably simple — but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be, because I'm on top of the sound. I have the sound coming this way. He would have the sound coming through the resonators. If there were no resonators on here, we would have:(Marimba sounds)So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn't experience, those of you in the back few rows wouldn't experience, either. Every single one of us, depending on where we're sitting, will experience this sound quite, quite differently. And of course, being the participator of the sound, and that is, starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce, for example, this sound:(No sound)Can you hear anything? Exactly — because I'm not even touching it.(Laughter)But yet, we get the sensation of something happening. In the same way that when I see a tree moves, then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound. Do you see what I mean? Whatever the eye sees, then there's always sound happening. So there's always, always that huge — I mean, just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from.So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience, and not by learning a piece of music, putting on someone else's interpretation of it, buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music, and so on and so forth, because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic, and something that I can fully experience the journey of. So it may be that, in certain halls, this dynamic may well work.(Soft marimba sounds)(Soft marimba sounds end)It may be that in other halls, they're simply not going to experience that at all, and so therefore, my level of soft, gentle playing may have to be —(Marimba sounds)(Marimba sounds end)Do you see what I mean? So, because of this explosion in access to sound, especially through the Deaf community, this has not only affected how music institutions, how schools for the deaf treat sound, and not just as a means of therapy — although, of course, being a participator of music, that definitely is the case as well — but it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together. There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics, dare I say. But by that I mean, where you can absolutely do anything you imagine. The tiniest, softest, softest sound to something that is so broad, so huge, so incredible. There's always something: it may sound good up there, may not be so good there; it may be great there, but terrible up there; maybe terrible over there, but not too bad there, etc., etc.So to find an actual hall is incredible — for which you can play exactly what you imagine, without it being cosmetically enhanced. So therefore, acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired, and who are participators of sound. And this is quite interesting. I cannot give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls, but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years, we've been saying, ""Well, how on earth can they experience music? They're deaf."" We go like that, and we imagine that's what deafness is about. Or we go like that, and we imagine that's what blindness is about. If we see someone in a wheelchair, we assume they cannot walk. It may be that they can walk three, four, five steps. That, to them, means they can walk. In a year's time, it could be two extra steps. In another year's time, three extra steps.Those are hugely important aspects to think about. So when we do listen to each other, it's unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills, to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber, to stop the judgment. For me, as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music, it's very easy for me to say, ""Oh yes, I like that piece. No, I don't like that piece,"" and so on. And I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time. It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music, but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music. And you know, one of the great things about being a musician is that it is so unbelievably fluid. So there are no rules, no right, no wrong, this way, that way.If I asked you to clap — maybe I can do this. If I can just say, ""Please clap and create the sound of thunder."" I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder. Now, I don't mean just the sound; I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves. And please try to create that through your clapping. Try, just — please try.(Loud clapping sounds)(Clapping ends)Snow.(Laughter)Snow.(Soft clapping sounds)Have you ever heard snow?Audience: No.Evelyn Glennie: Well, then, stop clapping.(Laughter)Try again. Try again: snow.(No sound)See, you're awake.Rain.(Light clapping sounds)EG: (Laughs)Not bad. Not bad. The interesting thing here, though, is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question. Now — great imagination, thank you very much. However, not one of you got out of your seats to think, ""Right! How can I clap? OK, maybe:(Clapping sounds)Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds. Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds."" Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands. In the same way, when we listen to music, we assume that it's all being fed through here. This is how we experience music. Of course, it's not.We experience thunder, thunder, thunder. Think, think, think. Listen, listen, listen. Now, what can we do with thunder? I remember my teacher, when I first started, my very first lesson, I was all prepared with sticks, ready to go. And instead of him saying, ""OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart, arms at a more or less 90-degree angle, sticks in a more or less V shape, keep this amount of space here, etc. Please keep your back straight, etc., etc., etc."" — where I was just probably going to end up absolutely rigid, frozen, and I would not be able to strike the drum because I was thinking of so many other things, he said, ""Evelyn, take this drum away for seven days, and I'll see you next week.""So — heavens! What was I to do? I no longer required the sticks. I wasn't allowed to have these sticks. I had to basically look at this particular drum, see how it was made, what these little lugs did, what the snares did. Turned it upside down, experimented with the shell.(Drum sounds)Experimented with the head.(Drum sounds)Experimented with my body.(Drum sounds)Experimented with jewelry. Experimented with all sorts of things.(Drum sounds)(Drum sounds end)And of course, I returned with all sorts of bruises.(Laughter)But nevertheless, it was such an unbelievable experience, because where on earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music? Where on earth are you going to experience that in a study book? So we never, ever dealt with actual study books. So for example, one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player as opposed to a musician, is basically, straightforward single-stroke rolls.(Drum sounds)Like that, and then we get a little faster —(Drum sounds)and a little faster —(Drum sounds)and a little faster, and so on and so forth. What does this piece require? Single-stroke rolls.(Drum sound)So why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music? And that's exactly what he did. And interestingly, the older I became, and when I became a full-time student at a so-called ""music institution,"" all of that went out of the window. We had to study from study books. And constantly, the question, ""Well, why? Why? What is this relating to? I need to play a piece of music."" ""Well, this will help your control."" ""Well, how? Why do I need to learn that? I need to relate it to a piece of music. You know, I need to say something.Why am I practicing paradiddles?(Drum sounds)Is it just literally for control, for hand-stick control? Why am I doing that? I need to have the reason, and the reason has to be by saying something through the music."" And by saying something through music, which basically is sound, we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people. But I don't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage. That's up to you, when you walk through a hall, because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things. I may feel sorrowful, or happy, or exhilarated, or angry when I play certain pieces of music, but I'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing. So please, the next time you go to a concert, just allow your body to open up, allow your body to be this resonating chamber. Be aware that you're not going to experience the same thing as the performer is.The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound, because they're hearing the contact of the stick —(Drum sound)on the drum, or the mallet on the bit of wood, or the bow on the string, etc., or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass. They're experiencing that rawness there. But yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure, which is before the sound is actually happening. Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike, or breath, is being pulled. Just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference, rather than just arriving last night.

"I’d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa — those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid. And, of course, I’m dedicating it also to my grandmother, whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles, especially for me when I was an activist, and being harassed by the police.You will recall that in 1976, June 16, the students of South Africa boycotted the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor, as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in Afrikaans — biology, mathematics — and what about our languages? And the students wanted to speak to the government, and police answered with bullets. So every year, June 16, we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died. And I was very young then. I think I was 11 years, and I started asking questions, and that’s when my political education started. And I joined, later on, the youth organization under the African National Congress. So as part of organizing this and whatever, this commemoration, the police will round us up as they call us leaders. And I used to run away from home, when I know that maybe the police might be coming around the ninth or 10th of June or so. And my grandmother one time said, ""No, look, you’re not going to run away. This is your place, you stay here."" And indeed, the police came — because they’ll just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like, after the 20th or so.So it was on the 10th of June, and they came, and they surrounded the house, and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house, and opened the kitchen door. And she said to them, ""Vusi's here, and you're not going to take him tonight. I'm tired of you having to come here, harassing us, while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes. He is here, and you're not going to take him. I've got a bowl full of boiling water — the first one who comes in here, gets it."" And they left.

"(Applause)It's really quite an honor to be here tonight, and I'm really glad that I stayed here and listened because I've really been inspired. And I'm going to play some songs for you tonight that are, literally, world premieres. I've been working on my new record and I've never played these songs for anybody except the microphone.This is a song that I wrote about the meaning of technology, which goes perfectly with this gathering. I started thinking about — when I was in college, especially as a blind person, doing a research paper was a major undertaking. You had to go to the library, see if you could get them to find the books for you, you know, footnotes and all that. Now you can just go on Google. Just look it up. I wish I had that when I was in college. Anyway, this is a song about: we have all this, but what are we going to do with it? It's called ""All the Answers.""♫ What is the weather in Cincinnati? ♫♫ What is the time in Tokyo? ♫♫ Who is this little child's daddy? ♫♫ And who the hell needs to know? ♫♫ Why do memories of you linger ♫♫ when I'm trying to reach my goal? ♫♫ And why must I move my fingers ♫♫ to the music in my soul? ♫♫ I don't know. ♫♫ I don't have to know. ♫♫ 'Cause here I go ... ♫♫ and I got all the answers ♫♫ right here in my hand. ♫♫ And I got all the answers ♫♫ and I don't have to understand ♫♫ 'cause I got all the answers. ♫♫ Think I'll rummage through the century ♫♫ while I listen to the sea. ♫♫ Oh, it's good to be so free, ♫♫ so free. ♫♫ Who was mayor of Chicago ♫♫ back in 1964? ♫♫ And why did Shakespeare create Iago ♫♫ to tear apart a love so pure? ♫♫ How can my dreams be so vivid ♫♫ in a psychosonic way? ♫♫ Why must I become so livid ♫♫ about the news I hear today? ♫♫ I don't know. ♫♫ I don't have to know. ♫♫ And here I go ... ♫♫ 'cause I got all the answers ♫♫ right here in my hand. ♫♫ And I got all the answers. ♫♫ See, I don't have to understand ♫♫ 'cause I got all the answers. ♫♫ I think I'll browse on through ♫♫ the tabloid news ♫♫ while I sip my tea. ♫♫ Mm, it's good to be so free. ♫(Trumpet sounds)♫ I never ever have to be alone. ♫♫ I can do it all right here in my home. ♫♫ Yeah, mm-hmm ... ♫♫ Everything that's ever been known, ♫♫ I can punch it up right here on my phone. ♫♫ Freedom train, coming soon ♫♫ right here in my living room ♫♫ from Baton Rouge to Saskatoon ♫♫ and all points in between. ♫♫ 'Cause I got all the answers ♫♫ right here on my screen. ♫♫ And I got all the answers, yeah. ♫♫ I got every book and magazine. ♫♫ I got all, I got all, I got all ... ♫♫ I got all the answers, ♫♫ all the answers, oh yeah. ♫♫ Uh-huh ... ♫♫ But I tell you what I'm going to do: ♫♫ I'm going to find the capitol of Peru ♫♫ or the latitude of Kathmandu. ♫♫ I'm gonna Google it ♫♫ 'cause everybody's doing it. ♫♫ And then I'll rummage through the century. ♫♫ I got all, I got all, I got all ... ♫♫ I got all the answers. ♫♫ Yeah, yeah ♫♫ I got all the answers. ♫(Applause)Thank you. Whew! It's a miracle I didn't make any mistakes on that song. That's the first time I've ever played it. (Applause) It's a ""feel the fear and do it anyway"" kind of thing. This next song is a songthat started out as a dream — a childhood dream. It was one of the titles that I was sort of thinking about calling my record, except there's a couple of problems. One thing is, it's unpronounceable. And it's a made-up word. It's called ""Tembererana."" And the song is based on what I think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces. So ""tembererana"" was these dreams, in which I would be running away from bad feelings — is the only way I can put it. So this is called ""Tembererana."" It's based on an Argentinian rhythm called ""carnivalito.""♫ A dream within a dream, ♫♫ a world within a world, ♫♫ the sound of a primal scream ♫♫ travels out across the land. ♫♫ Images flickering, ♫♫ the sound of the war machine, ♫♫ a procession of limousines ♫♫ travels slowly across the land. ♫♫ Another child could use a hand. ♫♫ Reaching out from within ♫♫ tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫♫ Annihilation moves. ♫♫ The earth is an open tomb. ♫♫ The sound of the final boom ♫♫ rumbles fiercely across the land. ♫♫ Fear, you're the enemy. ♫♫ Obliterating all but thee. ♫♫ You see what you want to see. ♫♫ Before I'm blinded, I will toast ♫♫ the shade of power that I love most, ♫♫ the power of creation. ♫♫ Tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫♫ Da, da, da, da ♫♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♫♫ As a child, alone and afraid, ♫♫ escaping the impressions every feeling made, ♫♫ I would run, run away ♫♫ into a world where the good was the aim of the game ♫♫ and the sum of invisible power ♫♫ had a name. ♫♫ It's the same name. ♫♫ Tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♫♫ Tembere, tembere, tembere, tembererana ♫♫ Tembere, tembere, tembere, tembererana, hey ♫♫ Tembererana, hey ♫♫ Tembererana ... ♫(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/raul_midon_plays_all_the_answers_and_tembererana

"(Music)(Applause)Thank you. Ooh, I'm like, ""Phew, phew, calm down. Get back into my body now."" (Laughter)Usually when I play out, the first thing that happens is people scream out, ""What's she doing?!"" I'll play at these rock shows, be on stage standing completely still, and they're like, ""What's she doing?! What's she doing?!"" And then I'll kind of be like — (Vvvwow!) — and then they're like, ""Whoa!"" (Laughter)I'm sure you're trying to figure out, ""Well, how does this thing work?"" Well, what I'm doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand. See, the closer I get to this antenna, the higher the note gets — (Portamento) — and you can get it really low. And with this hand I'm controlling the volume, so the further away my right hand gets, the louder it gets. (Tones) So basically, with both of your hands you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes, when really it's continuously going ... (Flourish ... Beep) (Laughter)Sometimes I startle myself: I'll forget that I have it on, and I'll lean over to pick up something, and then it goes like — (Blip) — ""Oh!"" And it's like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don't turn the thing off. (Laughter)Maybe we'll go into the next tune, because I totally lost where this is going. We're going to do a song by David Mash called ""Listen: the Words Are Gone,"" and maybe I'll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax.(Music)(Applause)So, I'm trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked; there are so many. And ... Well, I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin. It was invented around the 1920s, and the inventor, Léon Theremin — he also was a musician besides an inventor — he came up with the idea for making the theremin, I think, when he was working on some shortwave radios. And there'd be that sound in the signal — it's like (Screeching) — and he thought, ""Oh, what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument, because there are pitches in it."" And so somehow through developing that, he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now.And a lot of times, even kids nowadays, they'll make reference to a theremin by going, ""Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,"" because in the '50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies, that sound that's like ... (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo) (Laughter) It's kind of a funny, goofy sound to do.And sometimes if I have too much coffee, then my vibrato gets out of hand. You're really sensitive to your body and its functions when you're behind this thing. You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control. It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on — what Michael was doing — because you're fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you're playing with and stay in tune, and at the same time you don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time; you want to be feeling the music.And then also, you're trying to stay very, very, very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch, or sometimes if you're holding a low note — (Tone rising out of key) — and breathing will make it ...(Laughter)If I pass out on the next song ... (Laughter)I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing, or just aware of what you don't want it to be doing while you're playing; you don't want to have any sudden movements. And if I go to a club and play a gig, people are like, ""Here, have some drinks on us!"" And it's like, ""Well, I'm about to go on soon; I don't want to be like — (Teetering tones) — you know?""It really does reflect the mood that you're in also, if you're ... it's similar to being a vocalist, except instead of it coming out of your throat, you're controlling it just in the air and you don't really have a point of reference; you're always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly. You just have to always adjust to what's happening and realize you'll have bummer notes come here and there and listen to it, adjust it, and just move on, or else you'll get too tied up and go crazy. Like me.I think we will play another tune now. I'm going to do ""Lush Life."" It's one of my favorite tunes to play.(Music)(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/pamelia_kurstin_plays_the_theremin

"The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal. It means a lot to us. But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself. So, that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect — the idea that's been around for the last five to 10 years — that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [in utero], that it'll raise our IQ points 10, 20, 30 percent.Great idea, but it doesn't work at all. So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow. And I'd add to that, that it's not just making it, but everybody, each of us, everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way, and that's one of the main parts of my work. So, with the MIT Media Lab, for quite a while now, we've been engaged in a field called active music. What are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience, not just listening, but making music?And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers — we call these hyperinstruments — for Yo-Yo Ma, Peter Gabriel, Prince, orchestras, rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument, so the instrument knows how it's being played. And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling, I can turn my cello into a voice, or into a whole orchestra, or into something that nobody has ever heard before.When we started making these, I started thinking, why can't we make wonderful instruments like that for everybody, people who aren't fantastic Yo-Yo Mas or Princes? So, we've made a whole series of instruments. One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera. It's a whole orchestra of about 100 instruments, all designed for anybody to play using natural skill. So, you can play a video game, drive through a piece of music, use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound, touch a special surface to make melodies, use your voice to make a whole aura. And when we make the Brain Opera, we invite the public to come in, to try these instruments and then collaborate with us to help make each performance of the Brain Opera. We toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna, where we built a museum around it.And that led to something which you probably do know. Guitar Hero came out of our lab, and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface, people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music, and playing it over and over and over again.So, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg, because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero. And music is very fun, but it's also transformative. It's very, very important. Music can change your life, more than almost anything. It can change the way you communicate with others, it can change your body, it can change your mind. So, we're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero. We are very involved in education. We have a long-term project called Toy Symphony, where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive, but for little kids, so the kids will fall in love with making music, want to spend their time doing it, and then will demand to know how it works, how to make more, how to create. So, we make squeezy instruments, like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers, Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms — they gather your rhythm, and like hot potato, you send your rhythm to your friends, who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing — and a software package called Hyperscore, which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use, but once you use it, you can go quite deep — music in any style. And then, by pressing a button, it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces.We've had good enough, really, very powerful effects with kids around the world, and now people of all ages, using Hyperscore. So, we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities in a much broader context, for all kinds of people who don't usually have the opportunity to make music. So, one of the growing fields that we're working on at the Media Lab right now is music, mind and health. A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called ""Musicophilia"". It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book. If you haven't seen it, it's worth reading. He's a pianist himself, and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations.So we know, for instance, that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to. Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones, you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror, or can't tell anyone in their family, but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities. Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes, movement to people with Parkinson's disease. It's very powerful for depression, schizophrenia, many, many things.So, we're working on understanding those underlying principles and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health. And we do this in many ways. We work with many different hospitals. One of them is right near Boston, called Tewksbury Hospital. It's a long-term state hospital, where several years ago we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities. This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital, so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities. It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community. I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on. Video: They're manipulating each other's rhythms. It's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms, but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group. To get their hands on music, to shape it themselves, change it, to experiment with it, to make their own music. So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly. Everybody can experience music in a profound way, we just have to make different tools.The third idea I want to share with you is that music, paradoxically, I think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are. I love giving talks, although strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music. If I were here playing cello, or playing on a synth, or sharing my music with you, I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words, more personal things, perhaps deeper things.I think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have, from ourselves to the outside world. The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera, one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now. And it's about a man, rich, successful, powerful, who wants to live forever. So, he figures out a way to download himself into his environment, actually into a series of books. So this guy wants to live forever, he downloads himself into his environment. The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy.And the opera is about what we can share, what we can pass on to others, to the people we love, and what we can't. Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument, like this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier, but it's actually a robotic music instrument. So, as you can see in this prototype, gigantic piano strings, each string is controlled with a little robotic element — either little bows that stroke the strings, propellers that tickle the strings, acoustic signals that vibrate the strings. We also have an army of robots on stage. These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character, Simon Powers, and his family. There are a whole series of them, kind of like a Greek chorus. They observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now at MIT called OperaBots. These OperaBots follow my music. They follow the characters. They're smart enough, we hope, not to bump into each other. They go off on their own. And then they can also, when you snap, line up exactly the way you'd like to. Even though they're cubes, they actually have a lot of personality.The largest set piece in the opera is called The System. It's a series of books. Every single book is robotic, so they all move, they all make sound, and when you put them all together, they turn into these walls, which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers. So he's disappeared, but the whole physical environment becomes this person. This is how he's chosen to represent himself. The books also have high-packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display. And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System. This is a sneak preview. This premieres in Monaco — it's in September 2009. If by any chance you can't make it, another idea with this project — here's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form, through music and through the environment. But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces, as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love. So instead of being grand opera, this opera will turn into what we're thinking of as personal opera.And, if you're going to make a personal opera, what about a personal instrument? Everything I've shown you so far — whether it's a hyper-cello for Yo-Yo Ma or squeezy toy for a child — the instruments stayed the same and are valuable for a certain class of person: a virtuoso, a child. But what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way I personally behave, to the way my hands work, to what I do very skillfully, perhaps, to what I don't do so skillfully? I think that this is the future of interface, it's the future of music, the future of instruments.And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage, so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like. So, can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger, Ph.D. student from the MIT Media Lab, and Dan Ellsey. Dan, thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet, Dan is here with us today all the way from Tewksbury. He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital. This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital, I can tell you that, because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music. So, first of all, Dan, do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are?Dan Ellsey: Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey. I am 34 years old and I have cerebral palsy. I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software.Tod Machover: And we're really excited to have you here, really Dan. (Applause)So we met Dan about three years ago, three and a half years ago, when we started working at Tewksbury. Everybody we met there was fantastic, did fantastic music. Dan had never made music before, and it turned out he was really fantastic at it. He's a born composer. He's very shy, too. So, turned out he's a fantastic composer, and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours. He has made many, many pieces. He makes his own CDs. Actually, he is quite well known in the Boston area — mentors people at the hospital and children, locally, in how to make their own music. And I'll let Adam tell you. So, Adam is a Ph.D. student at MIT, an expert in music technology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators. What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan be able easily to make his own pieces, but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument. So, you want to say a little bit about how you guys work?Adam Boulanger: Yes. So, Tod and I entered into a discussion following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive person, and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face, it's in his breathing, it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform one of his pieces of music? That's our responsibility, and it doesn't make sense.So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance, with precision, with control, and despite his physical disability, to be able to do that, to be able to perform his piece of music. So, the process and the technology — basically, first we needed an engineering solution. So, you know, we have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer. We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to with his speaking controller. And this was actually the least interesting part of the work, you know, the design process. We needed an input; we needed continuous tracking; in the software, we look at the types of shapes he's making.But, then was the really interesting aspect of the work, following the engineering part, where, basically, we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out, you know, how does Dan move? What's useful to him as an expressive motion? You know, what's his metaphor for performance? What types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music? So all the parameter fitting, and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just Dan. And, you know, I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies — they provide access, they allow us to create pieces of creative work. But what about expression? What about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work? You know, do our technologies allow us to express? Do they provide structure for us to do that? And, you know, that's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So, you know, with Dan, we needed a new design process, a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform. And so that's what we'll do today.TM: So let's do it. So Dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play now?DE: This is ""My Eagle Song."" TM: So Dan is going to play a piece of his, called ""My Eagle Song"". In fact, this is the score for Dan's piece, completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore. So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore. He's incredibly fast at it, too, faster than I am, in fact.(Laughter)TM: He's really modest, too. So he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms. He can place those exactly where he wants. Each one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window, draws the lines, places everything the way he wants to. Looking at the Hyperscore, you can see it also, you can see where the sections are, something might continue for a while, change, get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end.So that's the way he made his piece, and as Adam says, we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece. It's going to be looked at by this camera, analyze his movements, it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to. And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen. We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring. But instead of making it very literal, showing you exactly the camera tracing, we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement, and shows the way it's being analyzed.I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what Dan's doing, but I think it will also show you, if you look at that movement, that when Dan makes music, his motions are very purposeful, very precise, very disciplined and they're also very beautiful. So, in hearing this piece, as I mentioned before, the most important thing is the music's great, and it'll show you who Dan is. So, are we ready Adam?AB: Yeah.TM: OK, now Dan will play his piece ""My Eagle Song"" for you. (Applause)TM: Bravo. (Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/tod_machover_and_dan_ellsey_play_new_music

It's completely fucked up and can only be explained in song.♫ Everyone is crying at the dread hypnotic flying ♫♫ of the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫♫ You can't walk, you can't ramble ♫♫ 'cause you're gonna have to scramble ♫♫ from the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫♫ Catbird is a cat ♫♫ but he's got bugness in his veins. ♫♫ Manhouse lives within himself ♫♫ with thoughtful human brains. ♫♫ Neither one is equal  ♫♫ to the challenge of the freak we'll call ♫♫ the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫♫ Now the moth ♫♫ defeats the mouse and man. ♫♫ It's messing with the plan. ♫♫ It can't be believed ♫♫ 'cause it's just a hummingbird moth ♫♫ who's acting like the bird ♫♫ that thinks it's a bee. ♫♫ Got a brand new shipment ♫♫ of electrical equipment ♫♫ it's addressed to the bottom of the sea. ♫♫ Send a tangerine-colored ♫♫ nuclear submarine ♫♫ with a sticker that says STP. ♫♫ Windshield wiper washer fluid ♫♫ spraying in the air ... ♫♫ headlights under head lice ♫♫ under hats lie everywhere. ♫♫ Subatomic waves ♫♫ to the underwater caves ♫♫ of the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫♫ Now the moth defeats the mouse and man. ♫♫ It's messing with the plan. ♫♫ It can't be believed ♫♫ 'cause it's just a hummingbird moth ♫♫ who's acting like a bird ♫♫ that thinks it's a bee. ♫♫ Is it us or is this messed up? ♫♫ Everyone's deforming ♫♫ in the presence of the swarming ♫♫ of the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫♫ Protozoa, snakes and horses ♫♫ have enlisted in the forces ♫♫ of the bee of bird of the moth. ♫♫ Catbug is a cat ♫♫ but he's got bugness in his veins. ♫♫ Manhouse lives within himself ♫♫ with thoughtful human brains. ♫♫ Neither one is equal ♫♫ to the challenge of the freak we'll call ♫♫ the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫(Applause)Thanks a lot. Thank you very much.So we are past our 1,000th show. Probably somewhere around 1,500. It's hard to know. We've only done two shows in 2007 so far, but our first show was actually the coldest performance we've ever had. It was 19 degrees in St. Louis about a month ago and I'm happy to report that this performance you are seeing today is the earliest we have ever performed. So thank you. We are cultural test pilots, ladies and gentlemen. How early can a rock performance begin? Not all the facts are in about performing at 8.30 in the morning. I can tell you the 19 degree thing was fantastic. All right.So we don't know that much about the history of violinists but we do know that when we entered the state of New Jersey there is an uptick in violence. This song is called ""Asbury Park."" It's based on a real life experience.♫ I ♫♫ I got ♫♫ I got kicked ♫♫ I got kicked in the head ♫♫ backstage at the Stone. ♫♫ Stone Pone. ♫♫ Stone Pony. ♫♫ I got kicked in the head ♫♫ backstage at the Stone Pony ♫♫ where I swore to the guy ♫♫ that the guy who took his beer wasn't me. ♫♫ Me got ♫♫ Me got kicked ♫♫ Me got kicked in the head ♫♫ backstage at the Stone. ♫♫ Stone Pone. ♫♫ Stone Pony. ♫♫ Me got kicked in the head ♫♫ backstage at the Stone Pony ♫♫ where I swore to the guy ♫♫ that the guy who took his beer ♫♫ was a guy dressed like me. ♫♫ Not me! ♫♫ Not me! ♫♫ Not me! ♫Thank you.

"I started juggling a long time ago, but long before that, I was a golfer, and that's what I was, a golfer. And as a golfer and as a kid, one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores, that I sort of lived my whole life, is process. And it's the process of learning things. One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer, but he was lefty. And he had a real passion for golf, and he also created this whole mythology about Ben Hogan and various things. Well, I learned a lot about interesting things that I knew nothing about at the time, but grew to know stuff about. And that was the mythology of skill.So, one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill. And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music — I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover with the MIT Media Lab — it relates a lot to music. But Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere, I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought, or not. But I'm going to explore skill, and juggling, and basically visual music, I guess. OK, you can start the music, thanks.(Music)(Applause)Thanks. Thank you. Now, juggling can be a lot of fun; play with skill and play with space, play with rhythm. And you can turn the mike on now. I'm going to do a couple of pieces. I do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it. Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands — because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented — but using the rhythm of my body and feet, and controlling the balls with my feet.(Applause)Thanks. Now, this next section was an attempt to explore space. You see, I think Richard said something about people that are against something. Well, a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff. Well, I kind of, from my childhood and golf and all that, it's a process of joining with forces. And so what I'd like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique. So juggling gravity — up, down. If you figure out what up and down really are, it's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything, but then you add in sideways.(Applause)Now, I look at it somewhat as a way — when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes, and see with your hands because you're not looking at your hands, you're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience. So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm, with the obvious reference to the feet, but it's also time — where the feet were, where the balls were.(Applause)Thanks. So, visual music: rhythm and complexity. I'm going to build towards complexity now. Juggling three balls is simple and normal.(Laughter)Excuse me.(Laughter)We're jugglers, OK. And remember, you're transposing, you're getting into a subculture here.(Laughter)And juggling — the balls cross and all that. OK, if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines of different heights, but then hopefully even rhythm. And you can change the rhythm — good, Michael. You can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights. OK? Change the rhythm, so it's even. Or you can go back and change the height. Now, skill. But you're boxed in, if you can only do it up and down that way. So, you've got to go after the space down there. OK, then you've got to combine them, because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you. And then you get crazy.(Applause)Now, I'm actually going to ask you to try something, so you've got to pay attention. Complexity: if you spend enough time doing something, time slows down or your skill increases, so your perceptions change. It's learning skills — like being in a high-speed car crash. Things slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn. You may not be able to affect it, it almost drifts on you. It goes. But that's the closest approximation I can have to it.So, complexity. Now, how many here are jugglers? OK, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this. OK? And whoever laughed there — you understood it completely, right?(Laughter)No, it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there, who's got his hands around that mess, OK. Well, that's what juggling is about, right? It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand. All right. So, that's one way of doing it, which is five balls down. OK? Another way is the outside. And you could play with the rhythm. Same pattern. Make it faster and smaller. Make it wider. Make it narrower. Bring it back up. OK. It's done. Thanks.(Applause)Now, what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright, very tactile. I have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are, but let's try something. OK, so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is, I'm going to give you a little clue. Enough of a clue? So, you get the pattern, right? OK.(Laughter)You're not getting off that easy. All right? Now, do me a favor: follow the ball that I ask you to follow. Green. Yellow. Pink. White. OK, you can do that? Yeah? OK.Now, let's actually learn something. Actually, let me put you in that area of learning, which is very insecure. You want to do it? Yeah? OK. Hands out in front of you. Palms up, together. What you're going to learn is this.(Laughter)OK? So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it. Index finger, middle finger, ring, little. Little, ring, middle, index. And then open. Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. A little bit faster. Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.(Laughter)All right. A lot of different learning processes going on in here.(Laughter)One learning process that I see is this —(Laughter)OK. Another learning process that I see is this —(Laughter)OK. So, everybody take a deep breath in, breath out. OK. Now, one more time, and — finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Open. Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. OK. Shake your hands out.Now, I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer. OK? So, what you're doing is, you're going la, la, la, and you're getting this. OK? So that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do, but in a slightly different way. You're going to combine it. So what I want you to do is — fingers. I'll tell you what to do with your fingers, same thing. But I want you to do is also, with your eyes, is follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow.(Laughter)OK? Here we go. So, we're going to start off looking at the white ball — and I'm going to tell you which color, and I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers. OK? So white ball and — finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Pink. Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Green. Finger, finger, finger, finger. Yellow. Finger, finger, finger, pink or finger. Pink, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. All right.(Applause)How did you do? Well? OK. The reason I wanted you to do this is because that's actually what most people face throughout their lives, a moment of learning, a moment of challenge. It's a moment that you can't make sense of. Why the hell should I learn this? OK? Does it really have anything to do with anything in my life? You know, I can't decipher — is it fun? Is it challenging? Am I supposed to cheat?(Laughter)You know, what are you supposed to do? You've got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life. OK? Trying to figure that stuff out. But is it going to get you anywhere? It's just a moment. That's all it is, a moment. OK? I'm going to change the script for one second. Just let me do this. I don't need music for it. Talking about time in a moment. There's a piece that I recently developed which was all about that, a moment. And what I do as a creative artist is I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects.What I've done for you here, I developed a lot of those tricks and I put the choreography together, but they're not original techniques. Now, I'm going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that I've developed. OK? So, a moment, how would you define a moment? Well, as a juggler, what I wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment.Ahhh. All right, I'm going to get on my knees and do it. So, a moment.(Rattling)OK? And then, what I did as a juggler was say, OK, what can I do to make that something that is dependent on something else, another dynamic.(Rattling)So, a moment.(Rattling)Another moment.(Rattling)Excuse me, still getting there. A moment that travels.(Rattling)A moment — no, we'll try that again. It separates, and comes back together. Time. How can you look at time? And what do you dedicate it to, in exploring a particular thing? Well, obviously, there's something in here, and you can all have a guess as to what it is. There's a mystery. There's a mystery in the moment. And it has to settle. And then it's dependent on something else. And then it comes to rest. Just a little thing about time.Now, this has expanded into a much bigger piece, because I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on while I'm keeping time with this. But I just thought I'd talk about a moment.(Applause)All right. OK. Can we show the video of the triangle? Are we ready to do that? Yes? This is the piece that I told you about. It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle.(Applause)Thanks. The only thing I'll say about the last session is, you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at 120 miles an hour?(Laughter)The only other thing is, it was a real shock. I always drove motorcycles. And when I bought my first car, it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents' house. Interesting.Anyway, balance: constant movement to find an approach to stillness. Cheating.(Laughter)Balance: making up the rules so you can't cheat, so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body. To have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen.(Laughter)Hup. Now, it's dependent on rhythm, and keeping a center of balance. When it falls, going underneath. So, there's a rhythm to it. The rhythm can get much smaller. As your skill increases, you learn to find those tinier spaces, those tinier movements. Thanks.(Applause)Now, I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways, and also — oh, actually, if you're bored, not here, here's one use for it.(Laughter)You can go with the ""Sticks One"" music.(Music)(Applause)Thanks. That has a certain kind of balance to it, which is all about plumb. I apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb, square and level. And they influenced that, and this next piece, which I'll do a little segment of. ""Two Sticks,"" you can go with it. Thanks. Which is again exploring space, or the lines in space.(Music)(Applause)Working with space and the lines in space in a different way. Oh, let's see here.(Applause)So, I'll come back to that in a second. But working with one ball, now, what if you attach something to it, or change it. This is a little thing that I made because I really like the idea of curves and balls together. And then creating space and the rhythm of space, using the surface of the balls, the surface of the arms. Just a little toy. Which leads me to the next thing, which is — what have I got here? OK. All right.I'm actually leading up to something, the newest thing that I'm working on. This is not it. This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape.(Applause)Now, what I just did was I worked with the mathematics — the diameter and the circumference. Sometimes these pieces are mathematical, in that way that I look at a shape and say, what about if I use this and this and this. Sometimes what happens in life affects my choice of objects that I try to work with.The next piece that I'm going to do — which is the cylinders piece, if you want to get that up — it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago, which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs. I love ceramics and all of that. It's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape, and the stories that were involved in it, as well as the fact that they protected the contents.The second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness. So, if you want to go with the music for cylinders.(Music)(Applause)Talking about geometry and everything, if you take the circle and you split it in half — can you run ""S-Curve music?"" I'm going to do just a short version of it. Circles split in half and rotated, and mythology.(Music)(Applause)Anyway, that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it, and I dance around a small stage so — two minutes, just to end? The latest piece that I'm working on — what I love is that I never know what I'm working on, why I'm working on it. They're not ideas, they're instincts. And the latest thing that I'm working on —(Clattering) —is something really — I don't know what it is yet. And that's good. I like not to know for as long as possible. Well, because then it tells me the truth, instead of me imposing the truth. And what it is, is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves. And what it involves, and I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not, but I'll do a little bit of it.It initially started off with me stacking these things, bunches of them, and then playing with the sense of space, of filling in the space. And then it started changing, and become folding on themselves. And then changing levels. Because my attempt is to make visual instruments, not to just make — I'll try one other thing. For work in three dimensions, with your perceptions of space and time. Now, I don't know exactly where it's going, but I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing. And it's going to change as I go through it. But I really like it, it feels right. This may not be the right shape, and — look at this shape, and then I'll show you the first design I ever put to it, just to see, just to play, because I love all different kinds of things to play with.

"Probably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen who went down to Africa in the 1900s. They were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for selling shoes, and they wrote telegrams back to Manchester. And one of them wrote, ""Situation hopeless. Stop. They don't wear shoes."" And the other one wrote, ""Glorious opportunity. They don't have any shoes yet.""(Laughter)Now, there's a similar situation in the classical music world, because there are some people who think that classical music is dying. And there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet. And rather than go into statistics and trends, and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing, and the record companies that are folding, I thought we should do an experiment tonight. Actually, it's not really an experiment, because I know the outcome.(Laughter)But it's like an experiment. Now, before we start —(Laughter)Before we start, I need to do two things. One is I want to remind you of what a seven-year-old child sounds like when he plays the piano. Maybe you have this child at home. He sounds something like this.(Music)(Music ends)I see some of you recognize this child. Now, if he practices for a year and takes lessons, he's now eight and he sounds like this.(Music)(Music ends)He practices for another year and takes lessons — he's nine.(Music)(Music ends)Then he practices for another year and takes lessons — now he's 10.(Music)(Music ends)At that point, they usually give up.(Laughter)(Applause)Now, if you'd waited for one more year, you would have heard this.(Music)(Music ends)Now, what happened was not maybe what you thought, which is, he suddenly became passionate, engaged, involved, got a new teacher, he hit puberty, or whatever it is. What actually happened was the impulses were reduced. You see, the first time, he was playing with an impulse on every note.(Music)And the second, with an impulse every other note.(Music)You can see it by looking at my head.(Laughter)The nine-year-old put an impulse on every four notes.(Music)The 10-year-old, on every eight notes.(Music)And the 11-year-old, one impulse on the whole phrase.(Music)I don't know how we got into this position.(Laughter)I didn't say, ""I'm going to move my shoulder over, move my body."" No, the music pushed me over, which is why I call it one-buttock playing.(Music)It can be the other buttock.(Music)You know, a gentleman was once watching a presentation I was doing, when I was working with a young pianist. He was the president of a corporation in Ohio. I was working with this young pianist, and said, ""The trouble with you is you're a two-buttock player. You should be a one-buttock player."" I moved his body while he was playing. And suddenly, the music took off. It took flight. The audience gasped when they heard the difference. Then I got a letter from this gentleman. He said, ""I was so moved. I went back and I transformed my entire company into a one-buttock company.""(Laughter)Now, the other thing I wanted to do is to tell you about you. There are 1,600 people, I believe. My estimation is that probably 45 of you are absolutely passionate about classical music. You adore classical music. Your FM is always on that classical dial. You have CDs in your car, and you go to the symphony, your children are playing instruments. You can't imagine your life without classical music. That's the first group, quite small. Then there's another bigger group. The people who don't mind classical music.(Laughter)You know, you've come home from a long day, and you take a glass of wine, and you put your feet up. A little Vivaldi in the background doesn't do any harm. That's the second group. Now comes the third group: people who never listen to classical music. It's just simply not part of your life. You might hear it like second-hand smoke at the airport ...(Laughter)— and maybe a little bit of a march from ""Aida"" when you come into the hall. But otherwise, you never hear it. That's probably the largest group.And then there's a very small group. These are the people who think they're tone-deaf. Amazing number of people think they're tone-deaf. Actually, I hear a lot, ""My husband is tone-deaf.""(Laughter)Actually, you cannot be tone-deaf. Nobody is tone-deaf. If you were tone-deaf, you couldn't change the gears on your car, in a stick shift car. You couldn't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome. And the telephone. The telephone. If your mother calls on the miserable telephone, she calls and says, ""Hello,"" you not only know who it is, you know what mood she's in. You have a fantastic ear. Everybody has a fantastic ear. So nobody is tone-deaf.But I tell you what. It doesn't work for me to go on with this thing, with such a wide gulf between those who understand, love and are passionate about classical music, and those who have no relationship to it at all. The tone-deaf people, they're no longer here. But even between those three categories, it's too wide a gulf. So I'm not going to go on until every single person in this room, downstairs and in Aspen, and everybody else looking, will come to love and understand classical music. So that's what we're going to do.Now, you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work, if you look at my face, right? It's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he's leading to realize whatever he's dreaming. Imagine if Martin Luther King had said, ""I have a dream. Of course, I'm not sure they'll be up to it.""(Laughter)All right. So I'm going to take a piece of Chopin. This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin. Some of you will know it.(Music)Do you know what I think probably happened here? When I started, you thought, ""How beautiful that sounds.""(Music)""I don't think we should go to the same place for our summer holidays next year.""(Laughter)It's funny, isn't it? It's funny how those thoughts kind of waft into your head. And of course —(Applause)Of course, if the piece is long and you've had a long day, you might actually drift off. Then your companion will dig you in the ribs and say, ""Wake up! It's culture!"" And then you feel even worse.(Laughter)But has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you, but because of us? Did anybody think while I was playing, ""Why is he using so many impulses?"" If I'd done this with my head you certainly would have thought it.(Music)(Music ends)And for the rest of your life, every time you hear classical music, you'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses.So let's see what's really going on here. We have a B. This is a B. The next note is a C. And the job of the C is to make the B sad. And it does, doesn't it?(Laughter)Composers know that. If they want sad music, they just play those two notes.(Music)But basically, it's just a B, with four sads.(Laughter)Now, it goes down to A. Now to G. And then to F. So we have B, A, G, F. And if we have B, A, G, F, what do we expect next?(Music)That might have been a fluke. Let's try it again.(Music)Oh, the TED choir.(Laughter)And you notice nobody is tone-deaf, right? Nobody is. You know, every village in Bangladesh and every hamlet in China — everybody knows: da, da, da, da — da. Everybody knows, who's expecting that E.Chopin didn't want to reach the E there, because what will have happened? It will be over, like Hamlet. Do you remember? Act One, scene three, he finds out his uncle killed his father. He keeps on going up to his uncle and almost killing him. And then he backs away, he goes up to him again, almost kills him. The critics sitting in the back row there, they have to have an opinion, so they say, ""Hamlet is a procrastinator."" Or they say, ""Hamlet has an Oedipus complex."" No, otherwise the play would be over, stupid.(Laughter)That's why Shakespeare puts all that stuff in Hamlet — Ophelia going mad, the play within the play, and Yorick's skull, and the gravediggers. That's in order to delay — until Act Five, he can kill him.It's the same with the Chopin. He's just about to reach the E, and he says, ""Oops, better go back up and do it again."" So he does it again. Now, he gets excited.(Music)That's excitement, don't worry about it. Now, he gets to F-sharp, and finally he goes down to E, but it's the wrong chord — because the chord he's looking for is this one, and instead he does ... Now, we call that a deceptive cadence, because it deceives us. I tell my students, ""If you have a deceptive cadence, raise your eyebrows, and everybody will know.""(Laughter)(Applause)Right. He gets to E, but it's the wrong chord. Now, he tries E again. That chord doesn't work. Now, he tries the E again. That chord doesn't work. Now, he tries E again, and that doesn't work. And then finally ... There was a gentleman in the front row who went, ""Mmm.""(Laughter)It's the same gesture he makes when he comes home after a long day, turns off the key in his car and says, ""Aah, I'm home."" Because we all know where home is.So this is a piece which goes from away to home. I'm going to play it all the way through and you're going to follow. B, C, B, C, B, C, B — down to A, down to G, down to F. Almost goes to E, but otherwise the play would be over. He goes back up to B, he gets very excited. Goes to F-sharp. Goes to E. It's the wrong chord. It's the wrong chord. And finally goes to E, and it's home. And what you're going to see is one-buttock playing.(Laughter)Because for me, to join the B to the E, I have to stop thinking about every single note along the way, and start thinking about the long, long line from B to E.You know, we were just in South Africa, and you can't go to South Africa without thinking of Mandela in jail for 27 years. What was he thinking about? Lunch? No, he was thinking about the vision for South Africa and for human beings. This is about vision. This is about the long line. Like the bird who flies over the field and doesn't care about the fences underneath, all right? So now, you're going to follow the line all the way from B to E. And I've one last request before I play this piece all the way through. Would you think of somebody who you adore, who's no longer there? A beloved grandmother, a lover — somebody in your life who you love with all your heart, but that person is no longer with you. Bring that person into your mind, and at the same time, follow the line all the way from B to E, and you'll hear everything that Chopin had to say.(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)Now, you may be wondering —(Applause)(Applause ends)You may be wondering why I'm clapping. Well, I did this at a school in Boston with about 70 seventh graders, 12-year-olds. I did exactly what I did with you, and I explained the whole thing. At the end, they went crazy, clapping. I was clapping. They were clapping. Finally, I said, ""Why am I clapping?"" And one of them said, ""Because we were listening.""(Laughter)Think of it. 1,600 people, busy people, involved in all sorts of different things, listening, understanding and being moved by a piece by Chopin. Now, that is something. Am I sure that every single person followed that, understood it, was moved by it? Of course, I can't be sure.But I'll tell you what happened to me in Ireland during the Troubles, 10 years ago, and I was working with some Catholic and Protestant kids on conflict resolution. And I did this with them — a risky thing to do, because they were street kids. And one of them came to me the next morning and he said, ""You know, I've never listened to classical music in my life, but when you played that shopping piece ...""(Laughter)He said, ""My brother was shot last year and I didn't cry for him. But last night, when you played that piece, he was the one I was thinking about. And I felt the tears streaming down my face. And it felt really good to cry for my brother."" So I made up my mind at that moment that classical music is for everybody. Everybody.Now, how would you walk — my profession, the music profession doesn't see it that way. They say three percent of the population likes classical music. If only we could move it to four percent, our problems would be over.(Laughter)How would you walk? How would you talk? How would you be? If you thought, ""Three percent of the population likes classical music, if only we could move it to four percent."" How would you walk or talk? How would you be? If you thought, ""Everybody loves classical music — they just haven't found out about it yet."" See, these are totally different worlds.Now, I had an amazing experience. I was 45 years old, I'd been conducting for 20 years, and I suddenly had a realization. The conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a sound. My picture appears on the front of the CD —(Laughter)But the conductor doesn't make a sound. He depends, for his power, on his ability to make other people powerful. And that changed everything for me. It was totally life-changing. People in my orchestra said, ""Ben, what happened?"" That's what happened. I realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people. And of course, I wanted to know whether I was doing that. How do you find out? You look at their eyes. If their eyes are shining, you know you're doing it. You could light up a village with this guy's eyes.(Laughter)Right. So if the eyes are shining, you know you're doing it. If the eyes are not shining, you get to ask a question. And this is the question: who am I being that my players' eyes are not shining? We can do that with our children, too. Who am I being, that my children's eyes are not shining? That's a totally different world.Now, we're all about to end this magical, on-the-mountain week, we're going back into the world. And I say, it's appropriate for us to ask the question, who are we being as we go back out into the world? And you know, I have a definition of success. For me, it's very simple. It's not about wealth and fame and power. It's about how many shining eyes I have around me.So now, I have one last thought, which is that it really makes a difference what we say — the words that come out of our mouth. I learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz, one of the rare survivors. She went to Auschwitz when she was 15 years old. And ... And her brother was eight, and the parents were lost. And she told me this, she said, ""We were in the train going to Auschwitz, and I looked down and saw my brother's shoes were missing. I said, 'Why are you so stupid, can't you keep your things together for goodness' sake?'"" The way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother. Unfortunately, it was the last thing she ever said to him, because she never saw him again. He did not survive. And so when she came out of Auschwitz, she made a vow. She told me this. She said, ""I walked out of Auschwitz into life and I made a vow. And the vow was, ""I will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing I ever say."" Now, can we do that? No. And we'll make ourselves wrong and others wrong. But it is a possibility to live into.Thank you.(Applause)Shining eyes.(Applause)Shining eyes.(Applause)Thank you, thank you.","https://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_zander_on_music_and_passion

"Ninety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners. Not being the musicians — the listeners, right? And we crave one thing, even though we kind of don't know it all the time. We crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded, the day it was played. And we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can. But then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded. And it turns out the further back you go in history, the little rougher it sounds. And so we said, there's a solution to this. Let's separate the performance, as a thing, out from the recording, which was how it was made. You know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day. But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers, and what instruments they were using. And it's the data hidden inside the recording. In order to do this, it's a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution. And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there. And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things — but full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computers and all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan. And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high-definition. And we were able to cross this line, called the uncanny valley, in terms of — artificial intelligence terms. We have a process where we, you know, kind of put it into the computer and digitize it, and then a whole lot of analysis. And we look at every single note, and all the attributes of those notes: how hard they were struck, and how they were held down, and how you move the fingers. So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers. And, you know, it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you, but we never had a science behind these kinds of things.I'm going to start with Glenn Gould. He died 25 years ago this year, and was born 75 years ago this year. Was a beloved pianist, maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century. He just got tired of being in front of an audience, and felt like — a performing monkey was, in fact, his term. So he stepped back, and did nothing but the crafting of his work. And Gould's specialty was playing Bach. His maybe most famous recording was something called ""The Goldberg Variations."" Bach only wrote themes and variations one time. He wrote some early pieces, but late in his life, in his mature period, he said, ""Here's a theme — 30 variations."" In fact, the theme isn't even the melody, it's the bass line. And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about, one in mono, and one in stereo. And the one in mono, by the way, he used the pedal, and as he got older, he said, ""No, no, wait a minute. I'm going to get very scientific about this, and not use the pedal."" What I'd like you to hear live is the 1955 version, and we'll play the first couple pieces of it. Glenn Gould, 1955. (Music) How about that? (Applause)So let me tell you a little bit how this was done. First of all, let me get you to the end step. This is — we have a fairly complex process that, you know, software and musicians and so on, but when we're all done, we know that the ear is the final arbiter. We can play the original in one ear, and a new recording in the other. So I'm going to do this for you right now, what you just heard. And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording, and the left speaker is going to be the new recording, actually of an instrument just like that one, and I'm going to play them together at the same time. (Music) That's the original. [Unclear] That's the two together. (Music)Before ""Jurassic Park,"" there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right? So, in the video world, we've been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior. And this is kind of another example of putting a science behind natural behavior. And then you heard the original. Ultimately, I started with the experience. And the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians. Lots of you can afford to buy one of these. But, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound. And I got to tell you, if you haven't heard high-definition surround, go down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer. It's so involving compared to regular stereo. But if you don't have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones. And so on the same disk we have five recordings — Sony has five recordings. And you could listen in headphones with this thing called binaural recording. And it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument, and it's got microphones where the ears are. And when you put on headphones, and you listen to this, you're inside of Glenn Gould's body. And it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians, who are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say, ""I can't believe it! It's just what it's like to play the piano."" Except now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano, and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions and moving through the whole process. It's a game changer.Here's now something we know in spectacular quality. The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. What you heard today was not perfect. It's an amalgam of wood, and cast iron, and felt, and steel strings, and all these, and they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity. So when you go into the recording session, you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to. There's the whole action there, sitting, kind of, on the side, and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano. Without putting dates next to these things, step-by-step music will be turned into data, like every field that's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years. Audio has come very late to this game — I'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering. I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from, which is how it was performed. And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool — they're high-resolution, and they're wired straight to our emotions, and you can't trick them very easily. Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know.All right, there's this episode of ""Star Trek."" (Laughter) I get it — it was all just laid in for me yesterday there. The episode of ""Star Trek"" for me was James Daly played Methuselah — remember this one? And at some point he's dancing with his — and I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967. Right, do you know where I'm going? And Nimoy, I'm sorry, Spock sits down at the piano, and he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it. And then Spock turns round, he goes, ""James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes, and I don't believe this is one of them in the category."" That's where I'm at. I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write. I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play. But I believe we're on a path now, when we get to data, that we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things, again, that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world. It's now coming in this world. The transition will be this one. It says right now, we think music is notes and how they're played. And I believe this is coming. Because what you've just heard was a computer playing data — no Glenn Gould in the room. But yet, it was human. And I believe you'll get to the next step, the real dream of listeners. Every time you listen to a recording today, every time you take out your iPod and whatever, every time you listen to it, it's the same thing — it's frozen. Wouldn't it be cool if every time you listened, it could be different? This morning, you're sadder, you want to hear your song, the same song, played sadder than you did yesterday. You want to hear it played by different musicians. You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever.We've seen all these ""Star Treks,"" and they're all holodeck episodes as well. Every time I listen to that, I get goose bumps. It's so amazing, it's so exciting. Every time I listen to that recording it's like, ""Oh my God, I can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening."" It's a way better experience than whatever you're used to listening to, in whatever form. And lastly, I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum. So I've really overshot my budget here. We made a new recording of him playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September. It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949. And I've got to tell you, we have this lab where we build and measure everything, back in Raleigh, North Carolina, and we flew out to Los Angeles. And as the president of the company, I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were. That's a real uncomfortable feeling, when all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team, and people are going to be sitting there in the audience. And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine, which has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people. And on the sweet spot on the stage, Tatum starts playing ... and every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedal was perfect, because he played it for that room on that day. And we captured all that data all over again. And I want you to hear that right now. And fortunately, it's right in here. This is an encore he used to do. It's one minute long. It's an Irish jig, and I want you to hear his humor. (Music) (Applause) And that's just what the live audience did. (Applause) So thank you very much, Michael, thank you for the opportunity.","https://www.ted.com/talks/john_walker_re_creates_great_performances

"This is Aunt Zip from Sodom, North Carolina. She was 105 years old when I took this picture. She was always saying things that made me stop and think, like, ""Time may be a great healer, but it ain't no beauty specialist."" (Laughter) She said, ""Be good to your friends. Why, without them, you'd be a total stranger."" (Laughter)This is one of her songs. Let's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together. And I'm going to have Michael Manring play bass with me. Give him a big old hand. (Applause)One, two, three, four.(Music)Well, my true love's a black-eyed daisy; if I don't see her, I go crazy.My true love lives up the river; a few more jumps and I'll be with her.Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey.Now you've got to picture Aunt Zip at 105 years old in Sodom, North Carolina. I'd go up and learn these old songs from her. She couldn't sing much, couldn't play anymore. And I'd pull her out on the front porch. Down below, there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule. A double outhouse over here on the side. And we'd sing this old song. She didn't have a whole lot of energy, so I'd sing, ""Hey, hey!"" and she'd just answer back with, ""Black-eyed Susie.""Oh, hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey.Well, she and I went blackberry picking. She got mad; I took a licking.Ducks on the millpond, geese in the ocean, Devil in the pretty girl when she takes a notion.Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey.Let's have the banjo.Well, we'll get married next Thanksgiving. I'll lay around; she'll make a living.She'll cook blackjacks, I'll cook gravy; we'll have chicken someday, maybe.Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey!One more time now. Oh, hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey.(Applause) Thank you, Michael.This is Ralph Stanley. When I was going to college at University of California at Santa Barbara in the College of Creative Studies, taking majors in biology and art, he came to the campus. This was in 1968, I guess it was. And he played his bluegrass style of music, but near the end of the concert, he played the old timing style of banjo picking that came from Africa, along with the banjo. It's called claw-hammer style, that he had learned from his mother and grandmother. I fell in love with that. I went up to him and said, how can I learn that? He said, well, you can go back to Clinch Mountain, where I'm from, or Asheville or Mount Airy, North Carolina — some place that has a lot of music. Because there's a lot of old people still living that play that old style.So I went back that very summer. I just fell in love with the culture and the people. And you know, I came back to school, I finished my degrees and told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player. You can imagine how excited they were.So I thought I would just like to show you some of the pictures I've taken of some of my mentors. Just a few of them, but maybe you'll get just a little hint of some of these folks.And play a little banjo. Let's do a little medley. (Music)(Applause) Those last few pictures were of Ray Hicks, who just passed away last year. He was one of the great American folk tale-tellers. The Old Jack tales that he had learned — he talked like this, you could hardly understand him. But it was really wonderful. And he lived in that house that his great-grandfather had built. No running water, no electricity. A wonderful, wonderful guy.And you can look at more pictures. I've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that I've done of some of the other folks I didn't get a chance to show you. This instrument came up in those pictures. It's called the mouth bow. It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world, and still played in the Southern mountains. Now, the old timers didn't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this. They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up. It was hard on the cats, but it made a great little instrument. It sounds something like this.(Music) Well, have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy about the many deeds of daring that were done by the Johnson boys?You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal. You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.Now, they were scouts in the rebels' army, they were known both far and wide.When the Yankees saw them coming, they'd lay down their guns and hide.You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal. You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.Ain't that a sound? (Applause)Well, it was 1954, I guess it was. We were driving in the car outside of Gatesville, Texas, where I grew up in the early part of my life. Outside of Gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store. My mom was driving; my brother and I were in the back seat. We were really mad at my mom. We looked out the window. We were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields. You see, we'd just been to the grocery store, and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it. And, buddy, that made us mad. Well, my mom didn't put up with much either, and she was driving, and she said, ""You boys! You think you can have anything you want. You don't know how hard it is to earn money. Your dad works so hard. You think money grows on trees. You've never worked a day in your lives. You boys make me so mad. You're going to get a job this summer.""She pulled the car over; she said, ""Get out of the car."" My brother and I stepped out of the car. We were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton. There were about a hundred black folks out there picking. My mom grabbed us by the shoulders. She marched us out in the field. She went up to the foreman; she said, ""I've got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives."" Of course, we were just eight and 10. (Laughter) She said, ""Would you put them to work?"" Well, that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman: put these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton field in August in Texas — it's hot. So he gave us each a cotton sack, about 10 feet long, about that big around, and we started picking. Now, cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers. And if you don't know what you're doing, your hands are bleeding in no time. And my brother and I started to pick it, and our hands were startin' to bleed, and then — ""Mom!"" And Mom was just sitting by the car like this. She wasn't going to give up.Well, the foreman could see he was in over his head, I guess. He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice. He just sang: ""Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know. Don't want it to leave me behind. Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know. Don't want it to leave me behind."" And from all around as people started singing and answering back, he sang: ""Good news, good news: Chariot's coming. Good news: Chariot's coming. Good news: Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me behind."" Now, my brother and I had never heard anything like that in our whole lives. It was so beautiful. We sat there all day picking cotton, without complaining, without crying, while they sang things like: ""Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you moan"" and ""Wade in the water,"" and ""I done done,"" ""This little light of mine.""Finally, by the end of the day, we'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton. But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar, but my mother would never let us cash it. I'm 57; still have the check. Now, my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work. But if you have children, you know it doesn't often work that way. No, we learned something else. The first thing I learned that day was that I never ever wanted to work that hard again. (Laughter) And pretty much never did. But I also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day, and that was an eye-opener. And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier. And it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can.Now, I was just a little eight-year-old boy that day when my mama put me out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field. I wasn't even aware of music — not even aware of it. But that day in the cotton field out there picking, when those people started singing, I realized I was in the very heart of real music, and that's where I've wanted to be ever since.Try this old song with me. I sing: Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.You sing: Don't want it to leave me behind. Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know. Don't want it to leave me behind.Good news, good news: Chariot's coming. Good news: Chariot's coming. Good news: Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me —It's been a while since you guys have been picking your last bale of cotton, isn't it? Let's try it one more time.There's a starry crown in heaven, I know. Don't want it to leave me behind. There's a starry crown in heaven, I know. Don't want it to leave me behind.Good news: Chariot's coming. Good news: Chariot's coming. Good news: Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me behind.It was a few years ago, but I sort of remembered this story, and I told it at a concert. My mom was in the audience. After the — she was glad to have a story about herself, of course, but after the concert she came up and she said, ""David, I've got to tell you something. I set that whole thing up. I set it up with the foreman. I set it up with the owner of the land. I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work. I didn't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though.""Let's try. Good news: Chariot's coming. Good news: Chariot's coming. Good news: Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me behind. (Applause)Well, this is the steel guitar. It's an American-made instrument. It was originally made by the Dopyera Brothers, who later on made the Dobro, which is a wood-bodied instrument with a metal cone for — where the sound comes from. It's usually played flat on your lap. It was made to play Hawaiian music back in the 1920s, before they had electric guitars, trying to make a loud guitar. And then African-American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck, just like that — a nice Merlot works very well. That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect. Break it off, put it on your finger, and slide into the notes. This instrument pretty much saved my life.Fifteen years ago, 14 years ago, I guess, this year, my wife and I lost our daughter, Sarah Jane, in a car accident, and it was the most — it almost took me out — it almost took me out of this world. And I think I learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief, just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in. I had to make lists of reasons to stay alive. I had to sit down and make lists, because I was ready to go; I was ready to check out of this world. And you know, at the top of the list, of course, were Jenny, and my son, Zeb, my parents — I didn't want to hurt them. But then, when I thought about it beyond that, it was very simple things. I didn't care about — I had a radio show, I have a radio show on public radio, ""Riverwalk,"" I didn't care about that. I didn't care about awards or money or anything. Nothing. Nothing. On the list it would be stuff like, seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring, the smell of new-mown hay, catching a wave and bodysurfing, the touch of a baby's hand, the sound of Doc Watson playing the guitar, listening to old records of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon. And for me, the sound of a steel guitar, because one of my parents' neighbors just gave me one of these things. And I would sit around with it, and I didn't know how to play it, but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play. And it was the only instrument that, of all the ones that I play, that would really make that connection. This is a song that came out of that.(Music) Well, I hear you're having trouble. Lord, I hate to hear that news. If you want to talk about it, you know, I will listen to you through.Words no longer say it; let me tell you what I always do. I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues.People say, ""Oh, snap out of it!"" Oh yeah, that's easier said than done. While you can hardly move, they're running around having all kinds of fun.Sometimes I think it's better just to sink way down in your funky mood 'til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues.Now, you can try to keep it all inside with drink and drugs and cigarettes, but you know that's not going to get you where you want to get.But I got some medicine here that just might shake things loose. Call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues. Open up now. (Applause)Oh, I think I've got time to tell you about this. My dad was an inventor. We moved to California when Sputnik went up, in 1957. And he was working on gyroscopes; he has a number of patents for that kind of thing. And we moved across the street from Michael and John Whitney. They were about my age. John went on, and Michael did too, to become some of the inventors of computer animation. Michael's dad was working on something called the computer. This was 1957, I was a little 10-year-old kid; I didn't know what that was. But he took me down to see one, you know, what they were making. It was like a library, just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see, just floors and floors of these things, and one of the engineers said, some day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket. I thought, damn, those are going to be some big pants! (Laughter)So that Christmas — maybe I've got time for this — that Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun-o-Rama chemistry set. Well, I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad; so did Michael. His great-granddad had been Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton gin. So we looked in that — this was a commercial chemistry set. It had three chemicals we were really surprised to see: sulfur, potassium nitrate and charcoal. Man, we were only 10, but we knew that made gunpowder. We made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway and we threw a match and phew, it flared up. Ah, it was great.Well, obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon. So we went over into Michael's garage — his dad had all kinds of stuff, and we put a pipe in the vice there, and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe, drilled a hole in the back of the pipe, took some of our firecrackers, pulled out the fuses, tied them together, put them in the back there, and — down in that hole — and then stuffed some of our gunpowder down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top, in the garage. (Laughter) We weren't stupid: we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it. We stood back, we lit that thing, and they flew out of there — they went through that plywood like it was paper. Through the garage. Two of them landed in the side door of his new Citroen. (Laughter) We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard. That was Pacific Palisades; it probably is still there, back there.Well, my brother heard that we had made gunpowder. He and his buddies, they were older, and they were pretty mean. They said they were going to beat us up if we didn't make some gunpowder for them. We said, well, what are you going to do with it? They said, we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel. (Laughter) Sure. We'll make you a big batch. (Laughter) So we made them a big batch, and it was in my — now, we'd just moved here. We'd just moved to California. Mom had redone the kitchen; Mom was gone that day. We had a pie tin. It became Chris Berquist's job to do the melting down. Michael and I were standing way at the side of the kitchen. He said, ""Yeah, hey, it's melting. Yeah, the sulfur's melting. No problem. Yeah, you know."" It just flared up, and he turned around, and he looked like this. No hair, no eyelashes, no nothing. There were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet; the air was the just full of black smoke. She came home, she took that chemistry set away, and we never saw it again. But we thought of it often, because every time she'd cook tuna surprise it made — tasted faintly of gunpowder.So I like to invent things too, and I think I'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back. When drum machines were new, I got to thinking, why couldn't you take the oldest form of music, the hambone rhythms, and combine it with the newest technology? I call this Thunderwear. At that time, drum triggers were new. And so I put them all together and sewed 12 of them in this suit. I showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday; I'm going to be doing some of the same ones. I have a trigger here, trigger here, here, here. Right there. It's going to really hurt if I don't take that off. Okay. Now, the drum triggers go out my tail here, into the drum machine, and they can make various sounds, like drums. So let me put them all together. And also, I can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right here, and — let me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this.Thank you, folks.

"Natalie MacMaster: I'm going to just quickly start out with a little bit of music here. (Applause)(Music)(Applause)Thank you! (Applause)I took my shoes off to dance, but maybe I'll get at that later. Anyways, I... where to start? Well, I'm really excited to talk a bit about my own upbringing in music and family and all of that, but I'm even more excited for you people to hear about Donnell's amazing family and maybe even a little bit about how we met, and all that sort of thing, but for those of you that may not be familiar with my upbringing, I'm from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, eastern Canada, which is a very, very musical island, and its origins come from Scotland with the music and all the traditions, the dancing, the language, which unfortunately is dying out in Cape Breton. The traditional language is Gaelic, but a lot of the music came from the Gaelic language, and the dancing and the singing and everything, and my bloodline is Scottish through and through, but my mother and father are two very, very musical people.My mom taught me to dance when I was five, and my dad taught me to play fiddle when I was nine. My uncle is a very well-known Cape Breton fiddler. His name's Buddy MacMaster, and just a wonderful guy, and we have a great tradition at home called square dancing, and we had parties, great parties at our house and the neighbors' houses, and you talk about kitchen cèilidhs. Well, cèilidh first of all is Gaelic for party, but kitchen party in Cape Breton is very common, and basically somebody drops into the house, and no matter what house you go to in Cape Breton, there's a fiddle there, guaranteed, and I'd say, well there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere in the world, so ten chances to one, the fellow who walked in the door could play it, so you'd have someone come into the house, you'd invite them to play a tune, and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance, and somebody would sing, and all that sort of thing, so it was a wonderful, wonderful way to grow up, and that is where my beginnings in music come from: my surroundings, my family, just my bloodline in itself, and, oh, I've done lots of things with my music.I've recorded lots of CDs. I was nominated for a Grammy and I've won some awards and stuff like that, so that's awesome, but the best part was meeting my husband, and I've actually known Donnell for probably 12 years now, and I'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess, how music brought us together, but I'm going to introduce you right now to my new husband as of October 5, Donnell Leahy. (Applause)(Applause)Donnell Leahy: Thank you. I'm kind of new to the TED experience and I'm glad to be here, but I'm just trying to put it all together, trying to figure all you people out, and I've been here for a short while, and I'm starting to understand a little bit better. So I asked Natalie, what do I do? And she said, just talk about yourself.It's kind of boring, but I'll just tell you a little bit about my family. I'm one of 11 brothers and sisters from Lakefield, Ontario, an hour and a half northeast of Toronto, and we grew up on a farm. Mom and Dad raised beef cattle, and I'm the oldest boy. There are four girls a little bit older than me. We grew up without a television. People find that strange, but I think it was a great blessing for us. We had a television for a few years, but of course we wasted so much time and the work wasn't getting done, so out went the television.We grew up playing— Mom's from Cape Breton, coincidentally. Mom and Natalie's mother knew each other. We grew up playing, and used to dance together, right, yeah. (Laughter) We grew up playing a bunch of, we played by ear and I think that's important for us because we were not really exposed to a lot of different styles of music.We learned to play the instruments, but we kind of had to come from within or go from within, because we didn't watch television, we didn't listen to a lot of radio. We went to church and to school sometimes, and farmed and played music, so we were able, I think, at a very critical age to develop our own style, our own self, and my mother plays, my father plays, and the style that came from the Ottawa Valley in Ontario, we call it French-Canadian style but it originated in logging camps. Years ago, hundreds of men would go up for the winter to the camps in Northern Ontario and in Quebec, and they were all different cultures, and the Irish, the French, Scottish, German, they'd all meet, and of course at night, they'd play cards and step dance and play fiddles, and over the course of many years, the Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolved and the Ottawa Valley step dancing evolved, so that's, I kind of started out with that style and I quickly started doing my own thing, and then I met Natalie, and I was exposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling. That's how we met. (Laughter) You tell them. (Laughter)NM: You want to or no? (Laughter) Well I guess I have to now. Well, it's just so interesting that Donnell's upbringing was very similar to mine, and I actually saw Donnell play when I was about 12 years old, and he and his family came to Inverness, which is about 45 minutes from where I lived, and I was just blown away, like, it was just amazing, and you'll find out why pretty soon here, but I couldn't believe the fiddling and Mom was there with me, and she was saying — Donnell's mother came up on stage and danced with her children, and Mom was saying, ""That's Julie MacDonnell, I used to dance with her when we were kids. Little did I think our children would be playing instruments, you know, playing music, yeah.""Twelve years, er, 20 years later little did she think her kids would be getting married, but anyway, so, then I got a phone call about, I dunno, seven years later. I was 19, first or second year of college, and it was Donnell, and he said ""Hi, you probably don't know me but my name is Donnell Leahy."" And I said, ""I know you. I have a tape of yours at home."" And he said, ""Well, I'm in Truro,"" which is where I was, and he asked me out for supper. That's it. (Laughter) (Applause) Then — Will I keep going? (Laughs) (Laughter) Then we dated for two years, broke up for 10, got back together and got married. (Laughter) (Applause)DL: So anyway, we're running out of time, so I'll just get to it. I'm going to play a piece of music for you. It's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen. I starts out with a slow air. Airs were played in Europe at burials, as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site, the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player. I'll quickly play a short part of the air, and then I'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you're not warmed up, so, if I mess it up, pretend you like it anyway. It's called The Banks.(Tuning)(Laughter)(Music)(Applause)NM: Well, we're gonna play one together now. (Applause) We're laughing, like, because our styles are totally different, as you can hear. And so, you know, Donnell and I are actually in the process of writing new pieces of music together that we can play, but we don't have any of those ready. We just started yesterday. (Laughter) So we're gonna play something together anyway.DL: With one minute.NM: With one minute.(Audience reaction)DL: You start. NM: No, you have to start, because you've got to do your thing.(Music)NM: I'm not tuned. Hold on.(Tuning)NM: I feel like I'm in the duck or the bird pose right now. (Laughter)(Music)(Audience claps along)(Applause)Announcer: Great news, they're running late downstairs. We've got another 10 minutes. (Applause)NM: Okay. Sure. All right, okay. Let's get her going. (Applause)(Tuning)DL: What do you want to play?NM: Well, um...(Music) (Laughter)NM: Uh, sure.DL: How fast?NM: Not too fast.(Music)(Audience claps along)(Cheering)(Audience claps along)(Music)(Applause)DL: We're going to play a tune and Natalie's going to accompany me on the piano. The Cape Breton piano playing is just awesome. It's very rhythmic and, you'll see it. My mom plays piano, and she learned to play before they had a piano at home in Cape Breton. Before Mom's family had a piano in Cape Breton, she learned to play the rhythms on a piece of board, and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter's evenings and Mom would be banging on this board, so when they bought a piano, they bought it in Toronto and had it taken by train and brought in on a horse, a horse and sleigh to the house. It became the only piano in the region, and Mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived, she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms. Anyway, we found the piano last year and were able to bring it back home. We purchased it. It had gone through, like, five or six families, and it was just a big thing for us, and we found actually an old picture of somebody and their family years ago. Anyway, I'm blabbering on here.NM: No, I want you to tell them about Leahy.DL: What about Leahy? (Laughter)NM: Just tell them what—DL: She wants me to talk about— We have a band named Leahy. There's 11 siblings. We, um— What will I tell them? (Laughter) We opened—NM: No surgeries.DL: No surgeries, oh yeah. We had a great opportunity. We opened for Shania Twain for two years on her international tour. It was a big thing for us, and now all my sisters are off having babies and the boys are all getting married, so we're staying close to home for, I guess, another couple of weeks. What can I say? I don't know what to say, Natalie. We, uh... (Laughter)(Laughter)NM: Is this what marriage is about? (Applause) I like it. (Applause)(Laughter)DL: Oh yeah, okay, in my family we had seven girls, four boys, we had two fiddles and one piano, and of course we were all fighting to play on the instruments, so dad and mom set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone off the instrument. You had to wait until they were finished, so of course, what we would do is we'd get on the piano and you wouldn't even get off to eat, because you wouldn't want to give it up to your brother or sister, and they'd wait and wait and wait, and it'd be midnight and you'd be still sitting there on the piano, but it was their way to get us to practice. Will we play a tune?NM: It worked. DL: It worked. Sorry, I hate to carry on... So this is our last number, and we'll feature Nat on piano. Okay, play in, how about A?(Music)(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/natalie_macmaster_and_donnell_leahy_play_the_cape_breton_fiddle

"I was thinking about my place in the universe, and about my first thought about what infinity might mean, when I was a child. And I thought that if time could reach forwards and backwards infinitely, doesn't that mean that every point in time is really infinitely small, and therefore somewhat meaningless. So we don't really have a place in the universe, as far as on a time line. But nothing else does either. Therefore every moment really is the most important moment that's ever happened, including this moment right now. And so therefore this music you're about to hear is maybe the most important music you'll ever hear in your life.(Laughter)(Applause)(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)(Applause)For those of you who I'll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards, you could please refrain from saying, ""Oh my god, you're so much shorter in real life.""

"I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal. And I come from a long way. I've been telling a story that has been so painful for me. It's been a tough journey for me, traveling the world, telling my story in form of a book. And also telling it like now. And also, the easiest one was when I was doing it in form of a music.So I have branded myself as a war child. I'm doing this because of an old lady in my village now, who have lost her children. There is no newspaper to cover her pain, and what she wants to change in this society. And I'm doing it for a young man who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can't write. Or there is no Internet, like Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, for them to talk.Also one thing that kept me pushing this story, this painful stories out, the dreams I have, sometimes, is like the voices of the dead, that I have seen would tell me, ""Don't give up. Keep on going."" Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it, because I didn't know what I was putting myself into.Well I was born in the most difficult time, when my country was at war. I saw my village burned down. The world that meant a lot to me, I saw it vanish in my face. I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five. My mother was claimed by the war. My brothers and sisters were scattered. And up to now, me and my father were detached and I still have issues with him. Seeing people die every day, my mother crying, it's like I was raised in a violence. And that made me call myself a war child.And not only that, when I was eight I became a child soldier.I didn't know what was the war for. But one thing I knew was an image that I saw that stuck in my head. When I went to the training camp I say, ""I want to kill as many Muslims, and as many Arabs, as possible."" The training wasn't easy, but that was the driving force, because I wanted to revenge for my family. I wanted to revenge for my village.Luckily now things have changed because I came to discover the truth. What was actually killing us wasn't the Muslims, wasn't the Arabs. It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system, and using religion to get what they want to get out of us, which is the oil, the diamond, the gold and the land. So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose: should I continue to hate, or let it go?So I happened to forgive. Now I sing music with the Muslims. I dance with them. I even had a movie out called ""War Child,"" funded by Muslim people. So that pain has gone out. But my story is huge. So I'm just going to go into a different step now, which is easier for me. I'm going to give you poem called ""Forced to Sin,"" which is from my album ""War Child."" I talk about my story. One of the journey that I tread when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around 400. And only 16 people survived that journey. So I hope you're going to hear this.My dreams are like torment. My every moment.Voices in my brain, of friends that was slain.Friends like Lual who died by my side,of starvation. In the burning jungle, and the desert plain.Next was I, but Jesus heard my cry.As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my comrade,he gave me comfort.We used to raid villages, stealing chickens, goats and sheeps,anything we could eat.I knew it was rude, but we needed food.And therefore I was forced to sin, forced to sin to make a living,forced to sin to make a living.Sometimes you gotta lose to win.Never give up. Never give in.Left home at the age of seven.One year later, live with an AK-47 by my side.Slept with one eye open wide.Run, duck, play dead and hide.I've seen my people die like flies.But I've never seen a dead body,at least one that I've killed.But still as I wonder, I won't go under.Guns barking like lightning and thunder.As a child so young and tender,Words I can't forget I still remember.I saw sergeant command raising his hand,no retreat, no surrender.I carry the banner of the trauma.War child, child without a mama,still fighting in the saga.Yet as I wage this new war I'm not alone in this drama.No sit or stop, as I reach for the topI'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop.I'm on a fight, day and night.Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right.It's like I'm living a dream.First time I'm feeling like a human being.Ah! The children of Darfur.Your empty bellies on the telly and now it's you that I'm fighting for.Left home. Don't even know the day I'll ever return.My country is war-torn.Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns.So many people die that I don't even cry no more.Ask God question, what am I here for.And why are my people poor.And why, why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write,I was learning how to fight.I ate snails, vultures, rabbits, snakes, and anything that had life.I was ready to eat.I know it's a shame. But who is to be blamed?That's my story shared in the form of a lesson.(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)What energized me and kept me going is the music I do. I never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy. So the music had been my therapy for me. It's been where I actually see heaven, where I can be happy, where I can be a child again, in dances, through music. So one thing I know about music: music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system, your mind, your heart, influence your soul and your spirit, and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing. Music is the only thing that can make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg, without even wanting to do it. And so the power music has I normally compare to the power love when love doesn't see a color. You know, if you fall in love with a frog, that's it.One testimony about how I find music is powerful is when I was still a soldier back then. I hated the people in the north. But I don't know why I don't hate their music. So we party and dance to their music. And one thing that shocked me is one day they brought an Arab musician to come and entertain the soldiers. And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music. But I had this question. So now I'm doing music so I know what the power of music is.So what's happening here? I've been in a painful journey. Today is day number 233 in which I only eat dinner. I don't eat breakfast. No lunch. And I've done a campaign called Lose to Win. Where I'm losing so that I could win the battle that I'm fighting now. So my breakfast, my lunch, I donate it to a charity that I founded because we want to build a school in Sudan.And I'm doing this because also it's a normal thing in my home, people eat one meal a day. Here I am in the West. I choose not to. So in my village now, kids there, they normally listen to BBC, or any radio, and they are waiting to know, the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school. And so I made a commitment. I say, ""I'm gonna not eat my breakfast."" I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month, but I've been humbled. (Laughter)So it's taken me 232 days. And I said, ""No stop until we get it."" And like it's been done on Facebook, MySpace. The people are giving three dollars. The lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents. Somebody donated 20 cents online. I don't know how they did it. (Laughter) But that moved me.And so, the importance of education to me is what I'm willing to die for. I'm willing to die for this, because I know what it can do to my people. Education enlighten your brain, give you so many chances, and you're able to survive. As a nation we have been crippled. For so many years we have fed on aid. You see a 20-years-old, 30-years-old families in a refugee camps. They only get the food that drops from the sky, from the U.N.So these people, you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid. If anybody want to help us this is what we need. Give us tools. Give the farmers tools. It's rain. Africa is fertile. They can grow the crops. (Applause) Invest in education. Education so that we have strong institution that can create a revolution to change everything. Because we have all those old men that are creating wars in Africa. They will die soon. But if you invest in education then we'll be able to change Africa. That's what I'm asking. (Applause)So in order to do that, I founded a charter called Gua Africa, where we put kids in school. And now we have a couple in university. We have like 40 kids, ex-child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support. And I said ""I'm going to put it in practice."" And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things. That's what I want to do to change, to make a difference in the world.Well now, my time is going, so I want to sing a song. But I'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker called Emma McCune that made it possible for me to be here. I'm gonna sing this song, just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference. She came to my country and saw the importance of education.She said the only way to help Sudan is to invest in the women, educating them, educating the children, so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society. So she even ended up marrying a commander from the SPLA. And she rescued over 150 child soldiers. One of them happened to be me now. And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me. Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma?Audience: Yes!Emmanuel Jal: All right.♫ This one goes to Emma McCune ♫♫ Angel to rescue came one afternoon ♫♫ I'm here because you rescued me ♫♫ I'm proud to carry your legacy ♫♫ Thank you.

"One day, Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music. And the source was a man, an African-American man, charming, rugged, homeless, playing a violin that only had two strings.And I'm telling a story that many of you know, because Steve's columns became the basis for a book, which was turned into a movie, with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, the Juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia. Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown, and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men, but how music helped shape that bond, and ultimately was instrumental — if you'll pardon the pun — in helping Nathaniel get off the streets.I met Mr. Ayers in 2008, two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall. He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies, and came backstage and introduced himself. He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series, all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony. And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs, and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life. But as a result now, he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes, the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days, wandering the streets of Skid Row, exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him.And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall — he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes, he was lost. And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke, and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep.And I was afraid, not for myself, but I was afraid that I was going to lose him, that he was going to sink into one of his states, and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy. (Laughter) So, I just started playing. And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.And as I played, I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel's eyes. It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical, a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music was its catalyst. And Nathaniel's manic rage was transformed into understanding, a quiet curiosity and grace. And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin and he started playing, by ear, certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete — Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius. And we started talking about music, from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms, Bruckner, all the B's, from Bartók, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music, but he related to this music at a personal level. He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic. And through playing music and talking about music, this man had transformed from the paranoid, disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming, erudite, brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician.Music is medicine. Music changes us. And for Nathaniel, music is sanity. Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity, into reality. And that is an escape from his tormented state. And I understood that this was the very essence of art. This was the very reason why we made music, that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core, our emotions, and through our artistic lens, through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality. And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us, inspires and unites us.And for Nathaniel, music brought him back into a fold of friends. The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him, that recognized his talents and respected him. And I will always make music with Nathaniel, whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row, because he reminds me why I became a musician. Thank you. (Applause)Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thanks. Robert Gupta. (Applause)Robert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists.

"(Music)♫ My age is three hundred ♫♫ and seventy-two ♫♫ I think with the deepest regret ♫♫ How I used to pick upand voraciously chew ♫♫ the dear little boysthat I met ♫♫ I've eaten them rawin their holiday suits, ♫♫ Eaten themcurried with rice, ♫♫ I've eaten them bakedin their jackets and boots, ♫♫ And found them exceedingly nice. ♫♫ But now that my jawsare too weak for such fare, ♫♫ I think it's increasingly rude ♫♫ To do such a thingwhen I'm quite well aware ♫♫ Little boys do not likebeing chewed. ♫♫ Little boys do not likebeing chewed. ♫(Music)♫ So now I contentedly live upon eels, ♫♫ And try to do nothing amiss ♫♫ And pass all the timeI can spare from my meals ♫♫ In innocent slumber like this, ♫♫ Innocent slumberlike this. ♫(Applause)I suppose I owe you an explanation. I've been working on a project for the last six years adapting children's poetry to music. And that's a poem by Charles Edward Carryl, who was a stockbroker in New York City for 45 years, but in the evenings, he wrote nonsense for his children. And this book was one of the most famous books in America for about 35 years. ""The Sleepy Giant,"" which is the song that I just sang, is one of his poems. Now, we're going to do other poems for you, and here's a preview of some of the poets. This is Rachel Field, Robert Graves — a very young Robert Graves — Christina Rossetti. Ghosts, right? Have nothing to say to us, obsolete, gone — not so. What I really enjoyed about this project is reviving these people's words. Taking them off the dead, flat pages. Bringing them to life, bringing them to light. So, what we're going to do next is a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane. Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn. When she was 10 years old in 1927, she published her first book of poems called ""The Janitor's Boy."" Here she is. And here's her poem.(Music)♫ Oh, I'm in lovewith the janitor's boy, ♫♫ And the janitor's boyis in love with me. ♫♫ Oh, I'm in lovewith the janitor's boy, ♫♫ And the janitor's boyis in love with me. ♫♫ He's going to hunt for a desert isle ♫♫ In our geography. ♫♫ A desert islewith spicy trees ♫♫ Somewhere in Sheepshead Bay; ♫♫ A right nice place,just fit for two ♫♫ Where we can live always. ♫♫ Oh, I'm in lovewith the janitor's boy, ♫♫ And the janitor's boy, ♫he's busy as can be; ♫♫ Down in the cellar he's making a raft ♫♫ Out of an old settee. ♫♫ He'll carry me off,I know that he will, ♫♫ For his hair is exceedingly red; ♫♫ And the only thingthat occurs to me ♫♫ Is to dutifully shiver in bed. ♫♫ And on the day that we sail,I will leave a little note ♫♫ For my parents I hate to annoy: ♫♫ ""I have flown to an islandin the bay ♫♫ With my janitor'sred haired-boy."" ♫♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫♫ I'm going to sail away ♫♫ Gone to Sheepshead Bay ♫♫ With my janitor's red-haired boy. ♫♫ On an old settee ♫♫ My red-haired boy and me ♫♫ The janitor's red-haired boy. ♫♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫(Applause)The next poem is by E.E. Cummings, ""Maggie and Milly and Molly and May.""(Music)♫ Maggie and Milly,Molly and May ♫♫ They went down to the beachone day to play ♫♫ And Maggie discovereda shell that sang ♫♫ So sweetly she couldn't rememberher troubles ♫♫ Maggie and Milly,Molly and May ♫♫ Maggie and Milly,Molly and May ♫♫ Milly befriendeda stranded star ♫♫ Whose rays,whose rays ♫♫ Five languid fingerswere ♫(Music)♫ Maggie and Milly,Molly and May ♫♫ Maggie and Milly,Molly and May ♫(Music)♫ Molly was chasedby a horrible thing ♫♫ Which racedsideways blowing ♫♫ Blowing ♫♫ Blowing ♫♫ May came homewith a smooth, round stone ♫♫ Small as a worldand as large as alone ♫(Music)♫ For whatever we loselike a you or a me ♫♫ Always ourselvesthat we findat the sea ♫(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)The next poem is ""If No One Ever Marries Me."" It was written by Laurence Alma-Tadema. She was the daughter of a very, very famous Dutch painter who had made his fame in England. He went there after the death of his wife of smallpox and brought his two young children. One was his daughter, Laurence. She wrote this poem when she was 18 years old in 1888, and I look at it as kind of a very sweet feminist manifesto tinged with a little bit of defiance and a little bit of resignation and regret.(Music)♫ Well, if no one ever marries me ♫♫ And I don't see why they should, ♫♫ Nurse says I'm not pretty, ♫♫ And you know I'm seldom good,seldom good — ♫♫ Well, if no one ever marries me ♫♫ I shan't mind very much; ♫♫ Buy a squirrel in a cage ♫♫ And a little rabbit-hutch. ♫♫ If no one marries me ♫♫ If no one marries me ♫♫ If no one marries me ♫♫ If no one marries me ♫♫ If no one marries me ♫♫ I'll have a cottage near a wood ♫♫ And a pony all my own ♫♫ A little lamb quite clean and tame ♫♫ That I can take to town. ♫♫ And when I'm really getting old — ♫♫ And 28 or nine — ♫♫ Buy myself a little orphan girl ♫♫ And bring her up as mine. ♫♫ If no one marries me ♫♫ If no one marries me ♫♫ If no one marries me ♫♫ If no one marries me ♫♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫♫ Marries me ♫♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫♫ Marries me ♫♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫ Thank you.(Applause) Thank you.I became very curious about the poets after spending six years with them, and started to research their lives, and then decided to write a book about it. And the burning question about Alma-Tadema was: Did she marry? And the answer was no, which I found in the London Times archive. She died alone in 1940 in the company of her books and her dear friends. Gerard Manley Hopkins, a saintly man. He became a Jesuit. He converted from his Anglican faith. He was moved to by the Tractarian Movement, the Oxford Movement, otherwise known as — and he became a Jesuit priest. He burned all his poetry at the age of 24 and then did not write another poem for at least seven years because he couldn't rectify the life of a poet with the life of a priest. He died typhoid fever at the age of 44, I believe, 43 or 44. At the time, he was teaching classics at Trinity College in Dublin. A few years before he died, after he had resumed writing poetry, but in secret, he confessed to a friend in a letter that I found when I was doing my research: ""I've written a verse. It is to explain death to a child, and it deserves a piece of plain-song music."" And my blood froze when I read that because I had written the plain-song music 130 years after he'd written the letter. And the poem is called, ""Spring and Fall.""♫ Margaret,are you grieving ♫♫ Over Goldengroveunleaving, by and by? ♫♫ Leaves, like the thingsof man, you ♫♫ With your fresh thoughts care for,can you? ♫♫ But as the heart grows older ♫♫ It will come to such sightsmuch colder ♫♫ By and by,nor spare a sigh ♫♫ Though worlds ofwanwood leafmeal lie; ♫♫ And yet you will weepand you'll know why. ♫♫ No matter child, the name: ♫♫ Sorrow's springs are all the same ♫♫ They're all the same. ♫♫ Nor mouth hadnor no mind expressed ♫♫ What heart heard of,ghost had guessed: ♫♫ It's the blightman was born for, ♫♫ It is Margaretthat you mourn for ♫Thank you so much.(Applause)(Music)I'd like to thank everybody, all the scientists, the philosophers, the architects, the inventors, the biologists, the botanists, the artists ... everyone that blew my mind this week.

"I've been playing TED for nearly a decade, and I've very rarely played any new songs of my own. And that was largely because there weren't any.(Laughter)So I've been busy with a couple of projects, and one of them was this: The Nutmeg. A 1930s ship's lifeboat, which I've been restoring in the garden of my beach house in England. And, so now, when the polar ice caps melt, my recording studio will rise up like an ark, and I'll float off into the drowned world like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel. During the day, the Nutmeg collects energy from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse, and from a 450 watt turbine up the mast. So that when it gets dark, I've got plenty of power. And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon. And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning, and I work on new songs. I'd like to play to you guys, if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it.(Applause)It's about Billie Holiday. And it appears that, some night in 1947 she left her physical space and was missing all night, until she reappeared in the morning. But I know where she was. She was with me on my lifeboat.

"(Music)[Sanskrit] This is an ode to the mother goddess, that most of us in India learn when we are children. I learned it when I was four at my mother's knee. That year she introduced me to dance, and thus began my tryst with classical dance. Since then — it's been four decades now — I've trained with the best in the field, performed across the globe, taught young and old alike, created, collaborated, choreographed, and wove a rich tapestry of artistry, achievement and awards. The crowning glory was in 2007, when I received this country's fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri, for my contribution to art.(Applause)But nothing, nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008. I heard the word ""carcinoma."" Yes, breast cancer. As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office, I heard other words: ""cancer,"" ""stage,"" ""grade."" Until then, Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend, stage was what I performed on, and grades were what I got in school. That day, I realized I had an unwelcome, uninvited, new life partner. As a dancer, I know the nine rasas or the navarasas: anger, valor, disgust, humor and fear. I thought I knew what fear was. That day, I learned what fear was.Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control, I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband, Jayant. I said, ""Is this it? Is this the end of the road? Is this the end of my dance?"" And he, the positive soul that he is, said, ""No, this is just a hiatus, a hiatus during the treatment, and you'll get back to doing what you do best.""I realized then that I, who thought I had complete control of my life, had control of only three things: My thought, my mind — the images that these thoughts created — and the action that derived from it. So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you, with the enormity of the situation, wanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness. I wanted to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, for which I needed something. I needed something that would pull me out of all this. So I dried my tears, and I declared to the world at large ... I said, ""Cancer's only one page in my life, and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life.""I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out, and I would not allow cancer to ride me. But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, I needed something. I needed an anchor, an image, a peg to peg this process on, so that I could go from there. And I found that in my dance, my dance, my strength, my energy, my passion, my very life breath. But it wasn't easy. Believe me, it definitely wasn't easy. How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days? How do you not despair when, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy, climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture, that to someone like me who could dance for three hours? How do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all? All I wanted to do was curl up and weep. But I kept telling myself fear and tears are options I did not have.So I would drag myself into my dance studio — body, mind and spirit — every day into my dance studio, and learn everything I learned when I was four, all over again, reworked, relearned, regrouped. It was excruciatingly painful, but I did it. Difficult. I focused on my mudras, on the imagery of my dance, on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself. And slowly, I moved out of that miserable state of mind.But I needed something else. I needed something to go that extra mile, and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four. The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini, of Durga. Durga, the mother goddess, the fearless one, created by the pantheon of Hindu gods. Durga, resplendent, bedecked, beautiful, her 18 arms ready for warfare, as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur. Durga, the epitome of creative feminine energy, or shakti. Durga, the fearless one. I made that image of Durga and her every attribute, her every nuance, my very own.Powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training, I brought laser-sharp focus into my dance, laser-sharp focus to such an extent that I danced a few weeks after surgery. I danced through chemo and radiation cycles, much to the dismay of my oncologist. I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule. What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance. Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life.My story is a story of overcoming setbacks, obstacles and challenges that life throws at you. My story is the power of thought. My story is the power of choice. It's the power of focus. It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you, so moves you, that something even like cancer becomes insignificant. My story is the power of a metaphor. It's the power of an image. Mine was that of Durga, Durga the fearless one. She was also called Simhanandini, the one who rode the lion.As I ride out, as I ride my own inner strength, my own inner resilience, armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment, as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer, asking my rogue cells to behave, I want to be known not as a cancer survivor, but as a cancer conqueror.I present to you an excerpt of that work ""Simhanandini.""(Applause)(Music)(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/ananda_shankar_jayant_fights_cancer_with_a_dance

"I am a cultural omnivore, one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod — an iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart, pop diva Christina Aguilera, country singer Josh Turner, gangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin, concerti, symphonies and more and more. I'm a voracious reader, a reader who deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer. I have read the Twilight tetralogy. And one who lives for my home theater, a home theater where I devour DVDs, video on demand and a lot of television. For me, ""Law & Order: SVU,"" Tina Fey and ""30 Rock"" and ""Judge Judy"" — ""The people are real, the cases are real, the rulings are final.""(Laughter)Now, I'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions, especially my passion for ""Judge Judy,"" and you'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us, but I'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life, a passion for the live professional performing arts, performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire, yes, but jazz as well, modern dance, opera, theater and more and more and more.Frankly, it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology. While we initially heralded the Internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems, we now realize that the Internet is, if anything, too effective in that regard. Depending on who you read, an arts organization or an artist, who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer, now competes with between three and 5,000 different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day. We now know, in fact, that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time. Five years ago, Gen Xers spent 20.7 hours online and TV, the majority on TV. Gen Yers spent even more — 23.8 hours, the majority online. And now, a typical university-entering student arrives at college already having spent 20,000 hours online and an additional 10,000 hours playing video games — a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined.Moreover, we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption. Thanks to the Internet, we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it, delivered to our own doorstep. We can shop at three in the morning or eight at night, ordering jeans tailor-made for our unique body types. Expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts — which have set curtain times, set venues, attendant inconveniences of travel, parking and the like — simply cannot meet. And we're all acutely aware: what's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony, opera or ballet ticket, when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free? These are enormous questions for those of us that work in this terrain. But as particular as they feel to us, we know we're not alone.All of us are engaged in a seismic, fundamental realignment of culture and communications, a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry, the magazine industry, the book and publishing industry and more. Saddled in the performing arts as we are, by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming, locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues, where we charge exorbitant prices. Many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves, ""Are we next?"" Everyone I talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich, who, in ""Dreams of a Common Language,"" wrote, ""We are out in a country that has no language, no laws. Whatever we do together is pure invention. The maps they gave us are out of date by years."" And for those of you who love the arts, aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day?(Laughter)(Applause)Now, rather than saying that we're on the brink of our own annihilation, I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation, a reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century. The arts reformation, like the religious Reformation, is spurred in part by technology, with indeed, the printing press really leading the charge on the religious Reformation. Both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion, internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models. And at heart, both reformations, I think, were asking the questions: who's entitled to practice? How are they entitled to practice? And indeed, do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine?Chris Anderson, someone I trust you all know, editor in chief of Wired magazine and author of The Long Tail, really was the first, for me, to nail a lot of this. He wrote a long time ago, you know, thanks to the invention of the Internet, web technology, minicams and more, the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history. In the 1930s, if any of you wanted to make a movie, you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO, because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring, and more? And now who in this room doesn't know a 14 year-old hard at work on her second, third, or fourth movie?(Laughter)Similarly, the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history. Again, in the '30s, Warner Brothers, RKO did that for you. Now, go to YouTube, Facebook; you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom.This double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market, a time when anyone is a potential author. Frankly, what we're seeing now in this environment is a massive time, when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting. But the number of arts participants, people who write poetry, who sing songs, who perform in church choirs, is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations. This group, others have called the pro-ams, amateur artists doing work at a professional level. You see them on YouTube, in dance competitions, film festivals and more. They are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary, while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions. Ultimately, we now live in a world defined not by consumption, but by participation.But I want to be clear, just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal Church or to the priesthood; I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance. They currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity — not opulence, of dignity. And they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home. But to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community is, by far, too shortsighted. And indeed, while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional, the single most exciting development in the last five to 10 years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist, the professional artist who works, not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage; but most frequently around women's rights, or human rights, or on global warming issues or AIDS relief for more — not out of economic necessity, but out of a deep, organic conviction that the work that she or he is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment.Today's dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada, but by Liz Lerman's Dance Exchange — a multi-generational, professional dance company, whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82, and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN. Today's professional theater community is defined, not only the Shaw and Stratford Festivals, but by the Cornerstone Theater of Los Angeles — a collective of artists that after 9/11, brought together 10 different religious communities — the Baha'i, the Catholic, the Muslim, the Jewish, even the Native American and the gay and lesbian communities of faith, helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play, where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross-community healing. Today's performers, like Rhodessa Jones, work in women's prisons, helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration, while today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more. And indeed, I think, rather than being annihilated, the performing arts are poised on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been.You know, we've said for a long time, we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town. And absolutely — I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy, dollars spent in restaurants or on parking, at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes, the piano tuner who tunes the instruments, and more. But the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward, especially in industries we can't even imagine yet, just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries, which few, if any of us, could have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago. Business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence, the ability to listen deeply, to have empathy, to articulate change, to motivate others — the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter.Especially now, as we all must confront the fallacy of a market-only orientation, uninformed by social conscience; we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters, and especially characters of the young people, who all too often are subjected to bombardment of sensation, rather than digested experience. Ultimately, especially now in this world, where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws, in reality TV that thrives on humiliation, and in a context of analysis, where the thing we hear most repeatedly, day in, day out in the United States, in every train station, every bus station, every plane station is, ""Ladies and gentlemen, please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest to you,"" when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion.The arts, whatever they do, whenever they call us together, invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity. God knows, if we ever needed that capacity in human history, we need it now. You know, we're bound together, not, I think by technology, entertainment and design, but by common cause. We work to promote healthy vibrant societies, to ameliorate human suffering, to promote a more thoughtful, substantive, empathic world order.I salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work, whatever your purpose may be. I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come.

"Well, there's lots to talk about, but I think I'm just going to play to start off.(Music)♫ When I wake up ♫ ♫ in the morning ♫ ♫ I pour the coffee ♫ ♫ I read the paper ♫ ♫ And then I slowly ♫ ♫ and so softly ♫ ♫ do the dishes ♫ ♫ So feed the fishes ♫ ♫ You sing me happy birthday ♫ ♫ Like it's gonna be ♫ ♫ your last day ♫ ♫ here on Earth ♫(Applause)All right. So, I wanted to do something special today. I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months. And there's few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience, especially when it's half-finished. (Laughter) I'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it. Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms. And so this is basically a song about loops, but not the kind of loops that I make up here. They're feedback loops. And in the audio world that's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source, and then it gets in this self-destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound. And I'm going to demonstrate for you. (Laughter) I'm not going to hurt you. Don't worry.♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a — (Feedback)All right. I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate — (Laughter) — but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction.And I've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms, from, say, the ecological, okay. There seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from, it gets ugly. So like, you can't feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease, and inbreeding and incest and, let's see, what's the other one? Biological — there's autoimmune diseases, where the body attacks itself a little too overzealously and destroys the host, or the person. And then — okay, this is where we get to the song — kind of bridges the gap to the emotional.Because although I've used scientific terms in songs, it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical. And there's some things you just don't need to have in songs. So I'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody. And so, I don't know if you've ever had this, but when I close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep, I can't stop thinking about my own eyes. And it's like your eyes start straining to see themselves. That's what it feels like to me. It's not pleasant. I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head. (Laughter) It's impossible, of course, for your eyes to see themselves, but they seem to be trying. So that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience. Or ears being able to hear themselves — it's just impossible. That's the thing. So, I've been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they're left to do the deed themselves, if that's possible. And that's what the song is asking. All right. It doesn't have a name yet.(Music)♫ Go ahead and congratulate yourself ♫ ♫ Give yourself a hand, the hand is your hand ♫ ♫ And the eye that eyes itself is your eye ♫ ♫ And the ear that hears itself is near ♫ ♫ 'Cause it's your ear, oh oh ♫ ♫ You've done the impossible now ♫ ♫ Took yourself apart ♫ ♫ You made yourself invulnerable ♫ ♫ No one can break your heart ♫ ♫ So you wear it out ♫ ♫ And you wring it out ♫ ♫ And you wear it out ♫ ♫ And you break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own ♫ (Applause)Thanks. (Applause) All right. It's kind of cool. Songwriters can sort of get away with murder. You can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research. But, you know, I think reckless curiosity would be what the world needs now, just a little bit. (Applause) I'm going to finish up with a song of mine called ""Weather Systems.""(Music)♫ Quiet ♫ ♫ Quiet down, she said ♫ ♫ Speak into the back of his head ♫ ♫ On the edge of the bed, I can see your blood flow ♫ ♫ I can see your ♫ ♫ cells grow ♫ ♫ Hold still awhile ♫ ♫ Don't spill the wine ♫ ♫ I can see it all from here ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ oh, I ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ ♫ Weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ ♫ Some things you say ♫ ♫ are not for sale ♫ ♫ I would hold it where ♫ ♫ our free agents of some substance are ♫ ♫ scared ♫ ♫ Hold still a while ♫ ♫ Don't spill the wine ♫ ♫ I can see it all from here ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ oh, I ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ weather systems of the world ♫ ♫ Weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫Thanks.(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_bird_s_one_man_orchestra_of_the_imagination

"(Whistling)(Whistling ends)(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Thank you very much. That was whistling. I'm trying to do this in English. What is a chubby, curly-haired guy from Holland — why is he whistling? Well actually, I've been whistling since the age of four, about four. My dad was always whistling around the house, and I just thought that's part of communication in my family. So I whistled along with him. And actually, until I was 34, I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling, because, to be honest, my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior. I whistled alone, I whistled in the classroom, I whistled on bike, I whistled everywhere.And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family-in-law. And they had some, in my opinion, terrible Christmas music. And when I hear music that I don't like, I try to make it better.(Laughter)So when ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" — you know it?(Whistling)But it can also sound like this.(Whistling)But during a Christmas party — at dinner, actually — it's very annoying. So my sister-in-law asked me a few times, ""Please stop whistling."" And I just couldn't. And at one point — and I had some wine, I have to admit that — at one point I said, ""If there was a contest, I would join.""And two weeks later, I received a text message: ""You're going to America.""(Laughter)So, OK, I'm going to America. I would love to, but why? So I immediately called her up, of course. She googled, and she found this World Whistling Championship in America, of course.(Laughter)She didn't expect me to go there. And I would have lost my face. I don't know if that's correct English. But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean.(Laughter)I lost my face.(Applause)And she thought, ""He will never go there."" But actually, I did. So I went to Louisburg, North Carolina, southeast of the United States, and I entered the world of whistling. And I also entered the World Championship, and I won there, in 2004.(Applause)That was great fun, of course. And to defend my title — like judokas do and sportsmen — I thought, well let's go back in 2005 — and I won again.(Laughter)Then I couldn't participate for a few years. And in 2008, I entered again in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again. So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam, in the beautiful city, on a big stage, and I'm talking about whistling. And actually, I earn my money whistling, at the moment. So I quit my day job as a nurse.(Applause)And I try to live my dream — well, actually, it was never my dream, but it sounds so good.(Laughter)OK, I'm not the only one whistling here. You say, ""Huh, what do you mean?"" Well actually, you are going to whistle along. And then always the same thing happens: people are watching each other and think, ""Oh, my God. Why? Can I go away?"" No, you can't.(Laughter)Actually, it's very simple. The track that I will whistle is called ""Fête de la Belle."" It's about 80 minutes long.(Laughter)No, no, no. It's four minutes long. And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling. Yes, so I whistle the tone.(Whistling)(Laughter)Sorry, I forgot one thing — you whistle the same tone as me.(Laughter)I heard a wide variety of tones.(Geert Chatrou and audience whistling)(Whistling ends)This is very promising.(Laughter)This is very promising. I'll ask the technicians to start the music. And if it's started, I just point where you whistle along, and we will see what happens.(Laughter)Oh, I'm so sorry, technicians.(Laughter)I'm so used to that.(Laughter)I start it myself.(Laughter)OK, here it is.(Laughter)(Music)(Whistling)(Whistling ends)(Music)OK.(Whistling)It's easy, isn't it?(Whistling)Now comes the solo, I propose I do that myself, OK?(Music)(Whistling)(Applause)Max Westerman: Geert Chatrou, the World Champion of Whistling.Geert Chatrou: Thank you.

"(Applause)(Music)(Applause)Angella Ahn: Thank you. (Applause) Thank you so much. We are so honored to be here at TEDWomen, sharing our music with you. What an exciting and inspiring event. What you just heard is ""Skylife"" by David Balakrishnan. We want to play you one more selection. It's by Astor Piazzolla, an Argentine composer. And we talk about different ideas — he had this idea that he thought music should be from the heart. This was in the middle of the 20th century when music from the heart, beautiful music, wasn't the most popular thing in the classical music world. It was more atonal and twelve-tone. And he insisted on beautiful music. So this is ""Oblivion"" by Astor Piazzolla.Thank you.(Music) (Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/ahn_trio_a_modern_take_on_piano_violin_cello

"(Singing)(Singing ends)(Applause)Pep Rosenfeld: Folks, you've just met Claron McFadden. She is a world-class soprano singer who studied in Rochester, New York. Her celebrated operatic roles are numerous and varied. In August 2007, Claron was awarded the Amsterdam Prize for the Arts, winning praise for her brilliance, her amazing and extensively wide repertoire and her vivid stage personality. Please welcome Claron McFadden.(Applause)Claron McFadden: The human voice: mysterious, spontaneous, primal. For me, the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel — except, perhaps, jealousy. And the breath, the breath is the captain of that vessel. A child is born, takes its first breath —(Inhales)Whah! And we behold the wondrous beauty of vocal expression — mysterious, spontaneous and primal.A few years ago, I did a meditation retreat in Thailand. I wanted a place where I would have total silence and total solitude. I spent two weeks at this retreat in my own little hut — no music, no nothing — sounds of nature, trying to find the essence of concentration, being in the moment.On my last day, the woman who looked after the place, she came and we spoke for a minute, and then she said to me, ""Would you sing something for me?"" And I thought, but this is a place of total quiet and silence. I can't make noise. She said, ""Please, sing for me."" So I closed my eyes, I took breath and the first thing that came up and out was ""Summertime,"" Porgy and Bess.(Singing) Summertime and the livin' is easy. Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high. Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'. So hush little baby, don't you cry.And I opened my eyes, and I saw that she had her eyes closed. And after a moment, she opened her eyes and she looked at me and she said, ""It's like meditation.""And in that moment I understood that everything I had gone to Thailand to look for, to search for, I had it already in my singing — the calm, but alertness, the focus, but awareness, and being totally in the moment. When you're totally in the moment — when I'm totally in the moment, the vessel of expression is open. The emotions can flow from me to you and back. It's an extremely profound experience.There's a piece by a composer, an American composer called John Cage. It's called ""Aria."" It was written for an amazing singer called Cathy Berberian. And the thing about this piece that's so special — if you see it behind me — it's not notated in any way. No notes, no flats, no sharps. But it's a kind of structure. And the singer, within this structure, has total freedom to be creative, spontaneous.For example, there are different colors and each color gets a different type of singing — pop, country and western, opera, jazz — and you just have to be consistent with that color. You see there are different lines. You choose in your own tempo in your own way to follow the line, but you must respect it, more or less. And these little dots, these represent a sort of sound that's not a vocal, not a lyrical way of expressing the voice. Using the body — it could be sneezing, it could be coughing, animals —(Audience member coughs)Exactly. (Laughter)Clapping, whatever. And there's different text. There's Armenian, Russian, French, English, Italian. So within this structure, one is free. To me, this piece is an ode to the voice, because it's mysterious, as we can see. It's quite spontaneous. And it's primal. So I would like to share this piece with you, It's ""Aria,"" of John Cage.(Singing in various languages)Hampart-zoumDirouhiDi questa TerraNaprasnoConscience et(Barks)(Singing) AriseTsk, tsk, tsk.(Singing)Vidiel’afacilmenteE io sono per te(Robotic voice) No other wayDans l'espace, so help(Singing)Si justeDvidzénya bistri(Claps)(Singing)On pekrásenidyot a k uO a k ho aSivayoot eternal loosin(Sneezes)(Laughs)Shh!(Singing)Gloobinoí più chiaraSi ceci est cela cela est ceciTotalmente soi whom they sought to slayTo have the fruits gloireJ’écoute ...À la vie…Leggermente snédznoiCoo cooP k t dBanalitéK o e(Makes the sound of a kiss)(Singing)In armonia(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/claron_mcfadden_singing_the_primal_mystery

"I wanted to be a rock star. I dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of. To be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star. This was in the late '80s. And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran. They wouldn't have me. I didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines. And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada. And I was certain that's what my life would be.And when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas when I was 18, I was stunned to find that there was not a Pop Star 101, or even a degree program for that interest. And the choir conductor there knew that I sang and invited me to come and join the choir. And I said, ""Yes, I would love to do that. It sounds great."" And I left the room and said, ""No way."" The choir people in my high school were pretty geeky, and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people. And about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said, ""Listen, you've got to join choir. At the end of the semester, we're taking a trip to Mexico, all expenses paid. And the soprano section is just full of hot girls."" And so I figured for Mexico and babes, I could do just about anything.And I went to my first day in choir, and I sat down with the basses and sort of looked over my shoulder to see what they were doing. They opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat, and boom, they launched into the Kyrie from the ""Requiem"" by Mozart. In my entire life I had seen in black and white, and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor. The most transformative experience I've ever had — in that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony and people singing, people together, the shared vision. And I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself. And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out.I decided to write a piece for choir a couple of years later as a gift to this conductor who had changed my life. I had learned to read music by then, or slowly learning to read music. And that piece was published, and then I wrote another piece, and that got published. And then I started conducting, and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School. And I find myself now in the unlikely position of standing in front of all of you as a professional classical composer and conductor.Well a couple of years ago, a friend of mine emailed me a link, a YouTube link, and said, ""You have got to see this."" And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me, singing the soprano line to a piece of mine called ""Sleep.""(Video) Britlin Losee: Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre. My name is Britlin Losee, and this is a video that I'd like to make for you. Here's me singing ""Sleep."" I'm a little nervous, just to let you know. ♫ If there are noises ♫ ♫ in the night ♫Eric Whitacre: I was thunderstruck. Britlin was so innocent and so sweet, and her voice was so pure. And I even loved seeing behind her; I could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room. Such an intimate video.And I had this idea: if I could get 50 people to all do this same thing, sing their parts — soprano, alto, tenor and bass — wherever they were in the world, post their videos to YouTube, we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir. So I wrote on my blog, ""OMG OMG."" I actually wrote, ""OMG,"" hopefully for the last time in public ever. (Laughter) And I sent out this call to singers. And I made free the download of the music to a piece that I had written in the year 2000 called ""Lux Aurumque,"" which means ""light and gold."" And lo and behold, people started uploading their videos.Now I should say, before that, what I did is I posted a conductor track of myself conducting. And it's in complete silence when I filmed it, because I was only hearing the music in my head, imagining the choir that would one day come to be. Afterwards, I played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to. And then as the videos started to come in ...(Singing) This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore.(Singing) This is Evangelina Etienne(Singing) from Massachusetts.(Singing) Stephen Hanson from Sweden.(Singing) This is Jamal Walker from Dallas, Texas.(Singing)There was even a little soprano solo in the piece, and so I had auditions. And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts. I was told later, and also by lots of singers who were involved in this, that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take — they uploaded it. Here's our winner of the soprano solo. This is Melody Myers from Tennessee. (Singing) I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note — like, ""No problem, everything's fine.""(Laughter)And from the crowd emerged this young man, Scott Haines. And he said, ""Listen, this is the project I've been looking for my whole life. I'd like to be the person to edit this all together."" I said, ""Thank you, Scott. I'm so glad that you found me."" And Scott aggregated all of the videos. He scrubbed the audio. He made sure that everything lined up. And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago. This is ""Lux Aurumque"" sung by the Virtual Choir.(Singing)I'll stop it there in the interest of time. (Applause)Thank you. Thank you.(Applause)Thank you. So there's more. There's more. Thank you so much.And I had the same reaction you did. I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it. I just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it — these souls all on their own desert island, sending electronic messages in bottles to each other. And the video went viral. We had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it. And because of that, then a lot of singers started saying, ""All right, what's Virtual Choir 2.0?"" And so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0 that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing, ""Sleep,"" which is another work that I wrote in the year 2000 — poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri. And again, I posted a conductor video, and we started accepting submissions. This time we got some more mature members. (Singing) And some younger members.(Video) Soprano: ♫ Upon my pillow ♫ ♫ Safe in bed ♫ EW: That's Georgie from England. She's only nine. Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen?Someone did all eight videos — a bass even singing the soprano parts. This is Beau Awtin. (Video) Beau Awtin: ♫ Safe in bed ♫EW: And our goal — it was sort of an arbitrary goal — there was an MTV video where they all sang ""Lollipop"" and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody. And there were 900 people involved in that. So I told the singers, ""That's our goal. That's the number for us to beat."" And we just closed submissions January 10th, and our final tally was 2,051 videos from 58 different countries. Thank you. (Applause) From Malta, Madagascar, Thailand, Vietnam, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand.And we also put a page on Facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials, what it was like for them, their experience singing it. And I've just chosen a few of them here. ""My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly. Now she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling. It's so wonderful to sing together again!"" I love the idea that she's singing with her sister. ""Aside from the beautiful music, it's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before, but who are connected anyway."" And my personal favorite, ""When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this, he told me that I did not have the voice for it."" Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too. Me too. ""It hurt so much, and I shed some tears, but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words. It is a dream come true to be part of this choir, as I've never been part of one. When I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map, I had to go with the nearest city, which is about 400 miles away from where I live. As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush, satellite is my connection to the world.""So two things struck me deeply about this. The first is that human beings will go to any lengths necessary to find and connect with each other. It doesn't matter the technology. And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection. It wasn't a virtual choir. There are people now online that are friends; they've never met. But, I know myself too, I feel this virtual esprit de corps, if you will, with all of them. I feel a closeness to this choir — almost like a family.What I'd like to close with then today is the first look at ""Sleep"" by Virtual Choir 2.0. This will be a premiere today. We're not finished with the video yet. You can imagine, with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos, the render time is just atrocious. But we do have the first three minutes. And it's a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first. You're the very first people to see this. This is ""Sleep,"" the Virtual Choir.(Video) Virtual Choir: ♫ The evening hangs ♫ ♫ beneath the moon ♫ ♫ A silver thread on darkened dune ♫ ♫ With closing eyes and resting head ♫ ♫ I know that sleep is coming soon ♫ ♫ Upon my pillow, ♫ ♫ safe in bed, ♫ ♫ a thousand pictures fill my head ♫ ♫ I cannot sleep ♫ ♫ my mind's aflight ♫ ♫ and yet my limbs seem made of lead ♫ ♫ If there are noises in the night ♫Eric Whitacre: Thank you very, very much.

"(Music)(Applause)Thank you.Imagining a solo cello concert, one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach unaccompanied cello suites. As a child studying these eternal masterpieces, Bach's music would intermingle with the singing voices of Muslim prayers from the neighboring Arab village of the northern Kibbutz in Israel where I grew up. Late at night, after hours of practicing, I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday as the sounds of tango music would be creeping from my parents' stereo. It all became music to me. I didn't hear the boundaries.I still start every day practicing playing Bach. His music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me. But as I was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression, I realized that with today's technological resources, there's no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument.The power and coherency that comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voices makes a very different experience. The excitement of a great orchestra performance comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians producing one unified whole concept. The excitement from using multi-tracking, the way I did in the piece you will hear next, comes from the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers, all generated from a single source. My cello and my voice are layered to create this large sonic canvas.When composers write music for me, I ask them to forget what they know about the cello. I hope to arrive at new territories to discover sounds I have never heard before. I want to create endless possibilities with this cello. I become the medium through which the music is being channeled, and in the process, when all is right, the music is transformed and so am I.(Music)(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/maya_beiser_s_and_her_cello_s

"(Non English)(French) Mais Des fois on peut voir parce Que Les gens ici faire Des choses on peut manger.(French) Mais quand tu es fâché avec quelqu'un c'est pas passé the first time.(British English) And that's one of the things that I enjoy most about this convention. It's not so much, as so little has to do with what everything is.(Laughter)But it is within our self-interest to understand the topography of our lives unto ourselves.(Laughter)The future states that there is no time other than the collapsation of that sensation of the mirror of the memories in which we are living.(Laughter)Common knowledge, but important nonetheless.(Laughter)As we face fear in these times, and fear is all around us, we also have anti-fear. It's hard to imagine or measure. The background radiation is simply too static to be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis.(American accent) But we feel as though there are times when a lot of us — you know what I'm saying? But — you know what I'm saying? Because, as a hip hop thing, you know what I'm saying, TED be rocking — you know what I'm saying. Like so I wrote a song, and I hope you guys dig it. It's a song about people and sasquatches —(Laughter)And other French science stuff. That's French science. Okay, here we go.(Singing) I've been trying inside I know that I'm in trouble(Applause)that I'm in trouble by myself But every time it gets me(Vocalization)(Beatbox)(Singing) And I've been trying to be the one that you believe in And you're the one that I want to be so saucy And you're the one I want to [unclear], baby And you can do anything as long as you don't get hurt along the way back(Beatbox)If I survive, I'm going to tell you what is wrong Because if you were [unclear] And I think that you're looking like a [unclear] I give you what I want to be(Music)(Music ends abruptly)(British accent) And it's like, you could use as many of those things that you want.(Applause) And the computer models, no matter how many that you have and how many people that you use, are never going to be able to arrive at the same conclusions. Four years ago I worked with a few people at the Brookings Institute, and I arrived at a conclusion.(Laughter)Tomorrow is another day.(Laughter)Not just any day, but it is a day. It will get here, there's no question.And the important thing to remember is that this simulation is a good one. It's believable, it's tactile. You can reach out — things are solid. You can move objects from one area to another. You can feel your body. You can say, ""I'd like to go over to this location,"" and you can move this mass of molecules through the air over to another location, at will.(Laughter)That's something you live inside of every day. Now with the allocation and the understanding of the lack of understanding, we enter into a new era of science in which we feel nothing more than so much so as to say that those within themselves, comporary or non-comporary, will figuratively figure into the folding of our non-understanding and our partial understanding to the networks of which we all draw our source and conclusions from.(Laughter)So, as I say before the last piece, feel not as though it is a sphere we live on, rather an infinite plane which has the illusion of leading yourself back to the point of origin.(Laughter)Once we understand that all the spheres in the sky are just large infinite planes, it will be plain to see.(Laughter)(Audience) (Laughter)This is my final piece. And just remember, everything you are — it's more important to realize the negative space, as music is only the division of space; it is the space we are listening to divided as such, which gives us the information in comparison to something other that gives us the idea of what the idea that wants to be transmitted wants to be. So please, without further ado.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)This is a fun one. It goes like this.(Beatbox)(Gibberish)(Music ends)Okay, for the last piece I'd like to do, this one goes very similar to this. I hope you guys recognize it. Here we go. Okay, that still works. Okay, good. All right, here we go.(Laughter)(Beatbox)Here we go.(Beatbox)Yeah, yo, yo, yo(Gibberish)(Music fades out)Thank you. Enjoy the rest.(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/reggie_watts_disorients_you_in_the_most_entertaining_way

And it finally happened, so ... (Laughter)CA: Preston, from your point of view, I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right?

"(Music) (Applause)Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. It's a distinct privilege to be here.A few weeks ago, I saw a video on YouTube of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets. This one entered her left hemisphere, and knocked out her Broca's area, the speech center of her brain. And in this session, Gabby's working with a speech therapist, and she's struggling to produce some of the most basic words, and you can see her growing more and more devastated, until she ultimately breaks down into sobbing tears, and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist. And after a few moments, her therapist tries a new tack, and they start singing together, and Gabby starts to sing through her tears, and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate the words to a song that describe the way she feels, and she sings, in one descending scale, she sings, ""Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine."" And it's a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail, in this case literally speak.Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug, one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard, and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy, which has become very popular in music therapy now. Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic, could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences, but they could still sing the lyrics to a song, whether it was ""Happy Birthday To You"" or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones. And after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons, he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere's damage.When I was 17, I visited Dr. Schlaug's lab, and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain — how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians, how music, and listening to music, could just light up the entire brain, from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum, how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism, to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression, how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music, and how late-stage Alzheimer's patients, whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family, could still pick out a tune by Chopin at the piano that they had learned when they were children.But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug, and it was this: that I was at a crossroads in my life, trying to choose between music and medicine. I had just completed my undergraduate, and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe, studying Parkinson's disease at Harvard, and I had fallen in love with neuroscience. I wanted to become a surgeon. I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes, these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia and work with AIDS patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, or with children with disfiguring cancers. I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor, that doctor without borders. On the other hand, I had played the violin my entire life.Music for me was more than a passion. It was obsession. It was oxygen. I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan, and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv, and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory, but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine. And that afternoon, I had to ask him, ""How was it for you making that decision?""And he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to, and that for me, medical school could wait, but that the violin simply would not. And after two more years of studying music, I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. Gupta. (Laughter) And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic. It was my first audition, and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week, I was offered the position. And it was a dream. It was a wild dream to perform in an orchestra, to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel, but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family, my new musical home.But a year later, I met another musician who had also studied at Juilliard, one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician. Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard, but he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s, was treated with thorazine at Bellevue, and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles 30 years later. Nathaniel's story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the United States, as told through the book and the movie ""The Soloist,"" but I became his friend, and I became his violin teacher, and I told him that wherever he had his violin, and wherever I had mine, I would play a lesson with him.And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row, I witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments, from what seemed to me in my untrained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode. Playing for Nathaniel, the music took on a deeper meaning, because now it was about communication, a communication where words failed, a communication of a message that went deeper than words, that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel's psyche, yet came as a true musical offering from me. I found myself growing outraged that someone like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row because of his mental illness, yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on Skid Row alone who had stories as tragic as his, but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets? And at the very core of this crisis of mine, I felt somehow the life of music had chosen me, where somehow, perhaps possibly in a very naive sense, I felt what Skid Row really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill.But in the end, it was Nathaniel who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change, if I wanted to make a difference, I already had the perfect instrument to do it, that music was the bridge that connected my world and his.There's a beautiful quote by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann, who said, ""To send light into the darkness of men's hearts, such is the duty of the artist."" And this is a particularly poignant quote because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum. And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel, I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians called Street Symphony, bringing the light of music into the very darkest places, performing for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics on Skid Row, performing for combat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, and for the incarcerated and those labeled as criminally insane.After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino, a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face, and she had a palsy, she was shaking, and she had this gorgeous smile, and she said that she had never heard classical music before, she didn't think she was going to like it, she had never heard a violin before, but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine, and that nobody ever came to visit them, and that for the first time in six years, when she heard us play, she stopped shaking without medication.Suddenly, what we're finding with these concerts, away from the stage, away from the footlights, out of the tuxedo tails, the musicians become the conduit for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room, would never have access to the kind of music that we make. Just as medicine serves to heal more than the building blocks of the body alone, the power and beauty of music transcends the ""E"" in the middle of our beloved acronym. Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone. The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by Wagner, or a symphony by Brahms, or chamber music by Beethoven, compels us to remember our shared, common humanity, the deeply communal connected consciousness, the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard-wired into our brain's right hemisphere. And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within homelessness and incarceration, the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them, to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them. And the spark of that beauty, the spark of that humanity transforms into hope, and we know, whether we choose the path of music or of medicine, that's the very first thing we must instill within our communities, within our audiences, if we want to inspire healing from within.I'd like to end with a quote by John Keats, the Romantic English poet, a very famous quote that I'm sure all of you know. Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry, but he died when he was a year older than me. And Keats said, ""Beauty is truth, and truth beauty. That is all ye know on Earth, and all ye need to know."" (Music) (Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_gupta_between_music_and_medicine

"(Breathes in)(Breathes out)So, I didn't always make my living from music. For about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university, this was my day job.(Laughter)I was a self-employed living statue called the Eight-Foot Bride, and I love telling people I did this for a job, because everybody always wants to know, who are these freaks in real life.(Laughter)Hello.I painted myself white one day, stood on a box, put a hat or a can at my feet, and when someone came by and dropped in money, I handed them a flower — and some intense eye contact. And if they didn't take the flower, I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing — as they walked away.(Laughter)So I had the most profound encounters with people, especially lonely people who looked like they hadn't talked to anyone in weeks, and we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street, and we would sort of fall in love a little bit. And my eyes would say — ""Thank you. I see you."" And their eyes would say — ""Nobody ever sees me. Thank you.""I would get harassed sometimes. People would yell at me from their cars. ""Get a job!"" (Laughing) And I'd be, like, ""This is my job."" But it hurt, because it made me fear that I was somehow doing something un-joblike and unfair, shameful. I had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting for the music business on this box. And for the economists out there, you may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income, which was shocking to me, given I had no regular customers, but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday, 90 bucks on a Friday. It was consistent.And meanwhile, I was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band, the Dresden Dolls. This was me on piano, a genius drummer. I wrote the songs, and eventually we started making enough money that I could quit being a statue, and as we started touring, I really didn't want to lose this sense of direct connection with people, because I loved it. So after all of our shows, we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people, and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us, and I would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows, and they would pass the hat, and then they would come in and join us onstage, so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird, random circus guests.And then Twitter came along, and made things even more magic, because I could ask instantly for anything anywhere. So I would need a piano to practice on, and an hour later I would be at a fan's house. This is in London. People would bring home-cooked food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us. This is in Seattle. Fans who worked in museums and stores and any kind of public space would wave their hands if I would decide to do a last-minute, spontaneous, free gig. This is a library in Auckland. On Saturday I tweeted for this crate and hat, because I did not want to schlep them from the East Coast, and they showed up care of this dude, Chris, from Newport Beach, who says hello. I once tweeted, ""Where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot?"" And a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe I was in, and I bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death.And I love this kind of random closeness, which is lucky, because I do a lot of couchsurfing. In mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there's no wireless, and in punk squats, everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless, clearly making it the better option.(Laughter)My crew once pulled our van up to a really poor Miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was an 18-year-old girl, still living at home, and her family were all undocumented immigrants from Honduras. And that night, her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds. And I lay there thinking, these people have so little. Is this fair? And in the morning, her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a Bible, and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English, ""Your music has helped my daughter so much. Thank you for staying here. We're all so grateful."" And I thought, this is fair. This is this.A couple of months later, I was in Manhattan, and I tweeted for a crash pad, and at midnight, I'm on the Lower East Side, and it occurs to me I've never actually done this alone. I've always been with my band or my crew. Is this what stupid people do?(Laughter)Is this how stupid people die? And before I can change my mind, the door busts open. She's an artist. He's a financial blogger for Reuters, and they're pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath, and I have had thousands of nights like that and like that.So I couchsurf a lot. I also crowdsurf a lot. I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing. You're falling into the audience and you're trusting each other. I once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get some extra money, something that I did a lot. And as usual, the band was psyched, but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn't bring himself to go out there. It felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat. And I recognized his fear of ""Is this fair?"" and ""Get a job.""And meanwhile, my band is becoming bigger and bigger. We sign with a major label. And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret. It's not for everybody. Well, maybe it's for you.(Laughter)We sign, and there's all this hype leading up to our next record. And it comes out and it sells about 25,000 copies in the first few weeks, and the label considers this a failure.I was like, ""25,000, isn't that a lot?""They said, ""No, the sales are going down. It's a failure."" And they walk off.Right at this same time, I'm signing and hugging after a gig, and a guy comes up to me and hands me a $10 bill, and he says, ""I'm sorry, I burned your CD from a friend.""(Laughter)""But I read your blog, I know you hate your label. I just want you to have this money.""And this starts happening all the time. I become the hat after my own gigs, but I have to physically stand there and take the help from people, and unlike the guy in the opening band, I've actually had a lot of practice standing there. Thank you.And this is the moment I decide I'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible, so it's like Metallica over here, Napster, bad; Amanda Palmer over here, and I'm going to encourage torrenting, downloading, sharing, but I'm going to ask for help, because I saw it work on the street. So I fought my way off my label, and for my next project with my new band, the Grand Theft Orchestra, I turned to crowdfunding. And I fell into those thousands of connections that I'd made, and I asked my crowd to catch me. And the goal was 100,000 dollars. My fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million, which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date.(Applause)And you can see how many people it is. It's about 25,000 people.And the media asked, ""Amanda, the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy. How did you make all these people pay for music?"" And the real answer is, I didn't make them. I asked them. And through the very act of asking people, I'd connected with them, and when you connect with them, people want to help you. It's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists. They don't want to ask for things. But it's not easy. It's not easy to ask. And a lot of artists have a problem with this. Asking makes you vulnerable.And I got a lot of criticism online, after my Kickstarter went big, for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices, specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer, and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website. And this hurt in a really familiar way. And people saying, ""You're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help,"" really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling, ""Get a job."" Because they weren't with us on the sidewalk, and they couldn't see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd, an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them.So this is slightly not safe for work. This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin. At the end of the night, I stripped and let everyone draw on me. Now let me tell you, if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers —(Laughter)I recommend this, especially if those strangers are drunk German people.(Laughter)This was a ninja master-level fan connection, because what I was really saying here was, I trust you this much. Should I? Show me.For most of human history, musicians, artists, they've been part of the community. Connectors and openers, not untouchable stars. Celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance, but the Internet and the content that we're freely able to share on it are taking us back. It's about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough. So a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price. They see it as an unpredictable risk, but the things I've done, the Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell, I don't see these things as risk. I see them as trust. Now, the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street, they're getting there. But the perfect tools aren't going to help us if we can't face each other and give and receive fearlessly, but, more important — to ask without shame.My music career has been spent trying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box. So blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers, our mistakes, and we see each other. And I think when we really see each other, we want to help each other.I think people have been obsessed with the wrong question, which is, ""How do we make people pay for music?"" What if we started asking, ""How do we let people pay for music?""Thank you.(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_palmer_the_art_of_asking

"In 1991 I had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life. I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree. I took a couple victory laps in there. And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California, and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus, and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains. And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise, and as we sat there, over the mountains coming in from the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds rolling toward us, and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley, so help me God, every single animal in that place stopped making noise at the same time. (Whoosh) This electric hush, as if they could sense what was about to happen. And then the clouds came over us, and then, boom! This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain. It was just extraordinary, and when I came back home I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz, and decided to set it to music, a piece for choir called ""Cloudburst,"" which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment.Now fast forward to just three years ago. (Music) And we released to YouTube this, the Virtual Choir Project, 185 singers from 12 different countries. You can see my little video there conducting these people, alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home. Two years ago, on this very stage, we premiered Virtual Choir 2, 2,052 singers from 58 different countries, this time performing a piece that I had written called ""Sleep."" And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir 3, ""Water Night,"" another piece that I had written, this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries. (Music)And when I was speaking to Chris about the future of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this, he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could. Could we do this all in real time? Could we have people singing together in real time?And with the help of Skype, that is what we are going to attempt today. Now, we'll perform ""Cloudburst"" for you. The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage. I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach, Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College, some of the best amateur choirs in the country, and — (Applause) — and in the second half of the piece, the virtual choir will join us, 30 different singers from 30 different countries.Now, we've pushed the technology as far as it can go, but there's still less than a second of latency, but in musical terms, that's a lifetime. We deal in milliseconds. So what I've done is, I've adapted ""Cloudburst"" so that it embraces the latency and the performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together.So with deep humility, and for your approval, we present ""Cloudburst.""(Applause)(Piano)[The rain ...] [Eyes of shadow-water] [eyes of well-water] [eyes of dream-water.] [Blue suns, green whirlwinds,] [birdbeaks of light pecking open] [pomegranate stars.] [But tell me, burnt earth, is there no water?] [Only blood, only dust,] [only naked footsteps on the thorns?] [The rain awakens...] [We must sleep with open eyes,] [we must dream with our hands,] [we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course,] [of the sun dreaming its worlds.] [We must dream aloud,] [we must sing till the song puts forth roots,] [trunk, branches, birds, stars.] [We must find the lost word,] [and remember what the blood,] [the tides, the earth, and the body say,] [and return to the point of departure...](Music)(Applause)[""Cloudburst"" Octavio Paz][translation by Lysander Kemp, adapted by Eric Whitacre]Eric Whitacre: Beth.

"(Music)(Applause)Thank you.Hi, everybody.Ban-gap-seum-ni-da.I'd like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life.I might look successful and happy being in front of you today, but I once suffered from severe depression and was in total despair. The violin, which meant everything to me, became a grave burden on me. Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me, their words sounded like meaningless noise. When I was just about to give everything up after years of suffering, I started to rediscover the true power of music.(Music)In the midst of hardship, it was the music that gave me — that restored my soul. The comfort the music gave me was just indescribable, and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too, and it totally changed my perspective on life and set me free from the pressure of becoming a successful violinist.Do you feel like you are all alone? I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart, as it did for me.(Music)(Applause)Thank you.Now, I use my music to reach people's hearts and have found there are no boundaries. My audience is anyone who is here to listen, even those who are not familiar with classical music. I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center, but also hospitals, churches, prisons, and restricted facilities for leprosy patients, just to mention a few.Now, with my last piece, I'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun, exciting, and that it can rock you. Let me introduce you to my brand new project, ""Baroque in Rock,"" which became a golden disc most recently. It's such an honor for me.I think, while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician, I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined. But it's now your turn. Changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world. Just play your life with all you have, and share it with the world. I really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by you, TEDsters.

"My name is Tom, and I've come here today to come clean about what I do for money. Basically, I use my mouth in strange ways in exchange for cash. (Laughter) I usually do this kind of thing in seedy downtown bars and on street corners, so this mightn't be the most appropriate setting, but I'd like to give you guys a bit of a demonstration about what I do. (Beatboxing) And now, for my next number, I'd like to return to the classics. (Applause) We're going to take it back, way back, back into time. (Beatboxing: ""Billie Jean"") ♫ Billie Jean is not my lover ♫ ♫ She's just a girl who claims that I am the one ♫ ♫ But the kid is not my son ♫ (Applause) All right. Wassup. Thank you very much, TEDx. If you guys haven't figured it out already, my name's Tom Thum, and I'm a beatboxer, which means all the sounds that you just heard were made entirely using just my voice, and the only thing was my voice. And I can assure you there are absolutely no effects on this microphone whatsoever. And I'm very, very stoked — (Applause) You guys are just applauding for everything. It's great. Look at this, Mom! I made it! I'm very, very stoked to be here today, representing my kinfolk and all those that haven't managed to make a career out of an innate ability for inhuman noisemaking. Because it is a bit of a niche market, and there's not much work going on, especially where I'm from. You know, I'm from Brisbane, which is a great city to live in. Yeah! All right! Most of Brisbane's here. That's good. (Laughter) You know, I'm from Brizzy, which is a great city to live in, but let's be honest — it's not exactly the cultural hub of the Southern Hemisphere. So I do a lot of my work outside Brisbane and outside Australia, and so the pursuit of this crazy passion of mine has enabled me to see so many amazing places in the world. So I'd like to share with you, if I may, my experiences. So ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take you on a journey throughout the continents and throughout sound itself. We start our journey in the central deserts. (Didgeridoo) (Airplane) India. (Beatboxing) (Sitar) China. (Guzheng) (Beatboxing) Germany. (Beatboxing) Party, party, yeah. (Laughter) And before we reach our final destination, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to share with you some technology that I brought all the way from the thriving metropolis of Brisbane. These things in front of me here are called Kaoss Pads, and they allow me to do a whole lot of different things with my voice. For example, the one on the left here allows me to add a little bit of reverb to my sound, which gives me that — (Trumpet) — flavor. (Laughter) And the other ones here, I can use them in unison to mimic the effect of a drum machine or something like that. I can sample in my own sounds and I can play it back just by hitting the pads here. (Noises) TEDx. (Music) (Applause) I got way too much time on my hands. And last but not least, the one on my right here allows me to loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop my voice. So with all that in mind, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take you on a journey to a completely separate part of Earth as I transform the Sydney Opera House into a smoky downtown jazz bar. All right boys, take it away. (Music) Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to a very special friend of mine, one of the greatest double bassists I know. Mr. Smokey Jefferson, let's take it for a walk. Come on, baby. (Music) All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to the star of the show, one of the greatest jazz legends of our time. Music lovers and jazz lovers alike, please give a warm hand of applause for the one and only Mr. Peeping Tom. Take it away. (Music) (Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much.

"I'd like you all to ask yourselves a question which you may never have asked yourselves before: What is possible with the human voice? What is possible with the human voice? (Beatboxing) ♪ Ooh baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying) ♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying) ♪ baby ♪ (Cat meowing) (Dog barking) Yeah. (Applause) (Boomerang noises) It was coming straight for me. I had to. It was, yeah. As you can probably well imagine, I was a strange child. (Laughter) Because the thing is, I was constantly trying to extend my repertoire of noises to be the very maximum that it could be. I was constantly experimenting with these noises. And I'm still on that mission. I'm still trying to find every noise that I can possibly make. And the thing is, I'm a bit older and wiser now, and I know that there's some noises I'll never be able to make because I'm hemmed in by my physical body, and there's things it can't do. And there's things that no one's voice can do. For example, no one can do two notes at the same time. You can do two-tone singing, which monks can do, which is like... (Two-tone singing) But that's cheating. And it hurts your throat. So there's things you can't do, and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me, because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world, but they're sketches at best, which is what's annoyed me. If only, if only there was a way for these ideas to come out unimpeded by the restrictions which my body gives it. So I've been working with these guys, and we've made a machine. We've made a system which is basically a live production machine, a real-time music production machine, and it enables me to, using nothing but my voice, create music in real time as I hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me. And I'm going to show you what it can do. And before I start making noises with it, and using it to manipulate my voice, I want to reiterate that everything that you're about to hear is being made by my voice. This system has — thank you, beautiful assistant — this system has no sounds in it itself until I start putting sounds in it, so there's no prerecorded samples of any kind. So once this thing really gets going, and it really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it, it becomes not obvious that it is the human voice, but it is, so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple. So the polyphony problem: I've only got one voice. How do I get around the problem of really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time. The simplest way to do it is something like this. (Beatboxing) By dancing. It's like this. (Music) Thanks. (Applause) So that's probably the easiest way. But if you want to do something a little bit more immediate, something that you can't achieve with live looping, there's other ways to layer your voice up. There's things like pitch-shifting, which are awesome, and I'm going to show you now what that sounds like. So I'm going to start another beat for you, like this. (Beatboxing) There's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start, because it's just fun, so you can clap along if you want. You don't have to. It's fine. Check it out. I'm going to lay down a bass sound now. (Music) And now, a rockabilly guitar. Which is nice. But what if I want to make, say, a — (Applause) — Thanks. What if I want to make, say, a rock organ? Is that possible? Yes, it is, by recording myself like this. (Organ sound) And now I have that, I have that recorded. Assign it to a keyboard. (Music) So that's cool. (Applause) But what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd? Impossible, you say. No. It is possible, and you can do it very simply using this machine. It's really fantastic. Check it out. (Music) So every noise you can hear there is my voice. I didn't just trigger something which sounds like that. There's no samples. There's no synthesizers. That is literally all my voice being manipulated, and when you get to that point, you have to ask, don't you, what's the point? Why do this? (Laughter) Because it's cheaper than hiring the whole of Pink Floyd, I suppose, is the easy answer. But in actual fact, I haven't made this machine so that I can emulate things that already exist. I've made this so that I can make any noise that I can imagine. So with your permission, I'm going to do some things that are in my mind, and I hope you enjoy them, because they're rather unusual, especially when you're doing things which are as unusual as this, it can be hard to believe that it is all my voice, you see.

"Adam Ockelford: I promise there won't be too much of me talking, and a lot of Derek playing, but I thought it would just be nice to recap on how Derek got to where he is today.It's amazing now, because he's so much bigger than me, but when Derek was born, he could have fitted on the palm of your hand. He was born three and a half months premature, and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive. He had to have a lot of oxygen, and that affected your eyes, Derek, and also the way you understand language and the way you understand the world. But that was the end of the bad news, because when Derek came home from the hospital, his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny who was going to look after you, Derek, really for the rest of your childhood. And Nanny's great insight, really, was to think, here's a child who can't see. Music must be the thing for Derek. And sure enough, she sang, or as Derek called it, warbled, to him for his first few years of life. And I think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe, you know, in his brain something was stirring, some sort of musical gift. Here's a little picture of Derek going up now, when you were with your nanny.Now Nanny's great other insight was to think, perhaps we should get Derek something to play, and sure enough, she dragged this little keyboard out of the loft, never thinking really that anything much would come of it. But Derek, your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bashed it, bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break. But out of all the bashing, after a few months, emerged the most fantastic music, and I think there was just a miracle moment, really, Derek, when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard. That was the great eureka moment.Now, not being able to see meant, of course, that you taught yourself.Derek Paravicini: I taught myself to play.AO: You did teach yourself to play, and as a consequence, playing the piano for you, Derek, was a lot of knuckles and karate chops, and even a bit of nose going on in there.And now, here's what Nanny did also do was to press the record button on one of those little early tape recorders that they had, and this is a wonderful tape, now, of Derek playing when you were four years old.DP: ""Molly Malone (Cockles and Mussels).""AO: It wasn't actually ""Cockles and Mussels."" This one is ""English Country Garden.""DP: ""English Country Garden.""(Music: ""English Country Garden"")AO: There you are.(Applause)I think that's just fantastic. You know, there's this little child who can't see, can't really understand much about the world, has no one in the family who plays an instrument, and yet he taught himself to play that. And as you can see from the picture, there was quite a lot of body action going on while you were playing, Derek.Now, along — Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old, and at first, Derek, I thought you were mad, to be honest, because when you played the piano, you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard, and also you had this little habit of hitting me out of the way. So as soon as I tried to get near the piano, I was firmly shoved off. And having said to your dad, Nic, that I would try to teach you, I was then slightly confused as to how I might go about that if I wasn't allowed near the piano. But after a while, I thought, well, the only way is to just pick you up, shove Derek over to the other side of the room, and in the 10 seconds that I got before Derek came back, I could just play something very quickly for him to learn. And in the end, Derek, I think you agreed that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together. As you can see, there's me in my early, pre-marriage days with a brown beard, and little Derek concentrating there.I just realized this is going to be recorded, isn't it? Right. Okay.(Laughter)Now then, by the age of 10, Derek really had taken the world by storm. This is a photo of you, Derek, playing at the Barbican with the Royal Philharmonic Pops. Basically it was just an exciting journey, really. And in those days, Derek, you didn't speak very much, and so there was always a moment of tension as to whether you'd actually understood what it was we were going to play and whether you'd play the right piece in the right key, and all that kind of thing. But the orchestra were wowed as well, and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability to play these fantastic pieces.Now the question is, how do you do it, Derek? And hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do.I think that one of the first things that happened when you were very little, Derek, was that by the time you were two, your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults. And so whenever you heard any note at all — if I just play a random note — (Piano notes) — you knew instantly what it was, and you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano. Now that's called perfect pitch, and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes in the middle of the piano.(Piano notes)You can see how — you get a sense of playing with Derek.(Applause)But Derek, your ear is so much more than that. If I just put the microphone down for a bit, I'm going to play a cluster of notes. Those of you who can see will know how many notes, but Derek, of course, can't. Not only can you say how many notes, it's being able to play them all at the same time. Here we are.(Chords)Well, forget the terminology, Derek. Fantastic. And it's that ability, that ability to hear simultaneous sounds, not only just single sounds, but when a whole orchestra is playing, Derek, you can hear every note, and instantly, through all those hours and hours of practice, reproduce those on the keyboard, that makes you, I think, is the basis of all your ability.Now then. It's no use having that kind of raw ability without the technique, and luckily, Derek, you decided that, once we did start learning, you'd let me help you learn all the scale fingerings. So for example using your thumb under with C major.(Piano notes)Etc.And in the end, you got so quick, that things like ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" were no problem, were they?DP: No.AO: Right. So here, by the age of 11, Derek was playing things like this.DP: This.(Music: ""Flight of the Bumblebee"") (Applause)AO: Derek, let's have a bow.Well done.Now the truly amazing thing was, with all those scales, Derek, you could not only play ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" in the usual key, but any note I play, Derek can play it on. So if I just choose a note at random, like that one. (Piano notes) Can you play ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" on that note?DP: ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" on that note.(Music: ""Flight of the Bumblebee"")AO: Or another one? How about in G minor?DP: G minor.(Music: ""Flight of the Bumblebee"")AO: Fantastic. Well done, Derek.So you see, in your brain, Derek, is this amazing musical computer that can instantly recalibrate, recalculate, all the pieces in the world that are out there. Most pianists would have a heart attack if you said, ""Sorry, do you mind playing 'Flight of the Bumblebee' in B minor instead of A minor?"" as we went on. In fact, the first time, Derek, you played that with an orchestra, you'd learned the version that you'd learned, and then the orchestra, in fact, did have a different version, so while we were waiting in the two hours before the rehearsal and the concert, Derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to play it with the orchestra. Fantastic chap.The other wonderful thing about you is memory.DP: Memory. AO: Your memory is truly amazing, and every concert we do, we ask the audience to participate, of course, by suggesting a piece Derek might like to play. And people say, ""Well, that's terribly brave because what happens if Derek doesn't know it?"" And I say, ""No, it's not brave at all, because if you ask for something that Derek doesn't know, you're invited to come and sing it first, and then he'll pick it up."" (Laughter)So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish.But seriously, would anyone like to choose a piece?DP: Choose a piece. Choose, choose, would you like to choose? AO: Because it's quite dark. You'll just have to shout out. Would you like to hear me play?(Audience: ""Theme of Paganini."")AO: Paganini. DP: ""The Theme of Paganini.""(Laughter)(Music: ""Theme of Paganini"")(Applause)AO: Well done.Derek's going to L.A. soon, and it's a milestone, because it means that Derek and I will have spent over 100 hours on long-haul flights together, which is quite interesting, isn't it Derek?DP: Very interesting, Adam, yes. Long-haul flights. Yes.AO: You may think 13 hours is a long time to keep talking, but Derek does it effortlessly. Now then.(Laughter)But in America, they've coined this term, ""the human iPod"" for Derek, which I think is just missing the point, really, because Derek, you're so much more than an iPod. You're a fantastic, creative musician, and I think that was nowhere clearer to see, really, than when we went to Slovenia, and someone — in a longer concert we tend to get people joining in, and this person, very, very nervously came onto the stage.DP: He played ""Chopsticks."" AO: And played ""Chopsticks.""DP: ""Chopsticks.""AO: A bit like this. DP: Like this. Yes.(Piano notes)AO: I should really get Derek's manager to come and play it. He's sitting there.DP: Somebody played ""Chopsticks"" like this. AO: Just teasing, right? Here we go.(Music: ""Chopsticks"")DP: Let Derek play it.AO: What did you do with it, Derek?DP: I got to improvise with it, Adam.AO: This is Derek the musician. (Music: ""Chopsticks"" improvisation)(Applause)(Music) (Clapping)Keep up with Derek.(Music)(Applause)The TED people will kill me, but perhaps there's time for one encore.DP: For one encore. AO: One encore, yes.So this is one of Derek's heroes. It's the great Art Tatum — DP: Art Tatum.AO: — who also was a pianist who couldn't see, and also, I think, like Derek, thought that all the world was a piano, so whenever Art Tatum plays something, it sounds like there's three pianos in the room. And here is Derek's take on Art Tatum's take on ""Tiger Rag.""DP: ""Tiger Rag.""(Music: ""Tiger Rag"")(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_paravicini_and_adam_ockelford_in_the_key_of_genius

"I'm assuming everyone here has watched a TED Talk online at one time or another, right? So what I'm going to do is play this. This is the song from the TED Talks online. (Music) And I'm going to slow it down because things sound cooler when they're slower. (Music) Ken Robinson: Good morning. How are you? Mark Applebaum: I'm going to — Kate Stone: — mix some music. MA: I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story. Tod Machover: Something nobody's ever heard before. KS: I have a crossfader. Julian Treasure: I call this the mixer. KS: Two D.J. decks. Chris Anderson: You turn up the  dials, the wheel starts to turn. Dan Ellsey: I have always loved music. Michael Tilson Thomas: Is it a melody  or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude? Daniel Wolpert: Feeling everything  that's going on inside my body. Adam Ockelford: In your brain is  this amazing musical computer. MTT: Using computers and synthesizers to create  works. It's a language that's still evolving. And the 21st century. KR: Turn on the radio. Pop into the discotheque. You will know what this person  is doing: moving to the music. Mark Ronson: This is my favorite part. MA: You gotta have doorstops. That's important. TM: We all love music a great deal. MTT: Anthems, dance crazes, ballads and marches. Kirby Ferguson and JT: The remix: It  is new music created from old music. Ryan Holladay: Blend seamlessly. Kathryn Schulz: And that's how it goes. MTT: What happens when the music stops? KS: Yay! (Applause) MR: Obviously, I've been watching a lot of TED Talks. When I was first asked to speak at TED, I wasn't quite sure what my angle was, at first, so yeah, I immediately started watching tons of TED Talks, which is pretty much absolutely the worst thing that you can do because you start to go into panic mode, thinking, I haven't mounted a successful expedition to the North Pole yet. Neither have I provided electricity to my village through sheer ingenuity. In fact, I've pretty much wasted most of my life DJing in night clubs and producing pop records.But I still kept watching the videos, because I'm a masochist, and eventually, things like Michael Tilson Thomas and Tod Machover, and seeing their visceral passion talking about music, it definitely stirred something in me, and I'm a sucker for anyone talking devotedly about the power of music. And I started to write down on these little note cards every time I heard something that struck a chord in me, pardon the pun, or something that I thought I could use, and pretty soon, my studio looked like this, kind of like a John Nash, ""Beautiful Mind"" vibe.The other good thing about watching TED Talks, when you see a really good one, you kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker was your best friend, don't you? Like, just for a day. They seem like a nice person. You'd take a bike ride, maybe share an ice cream. You'd certainly learn a lot. And every now and then they'd chide you, when they got frustrated that you couldn't really keep up with half of the technical things they're banging on about all the time. But then they'd remember that you're but a mere human of ordinary, mortal intelligence that didn't finish university, and they'd kind of forgive you, and pet you like the dog. (Laughter)Man, yeah, back to the real world, probably Sir Ken Robinson and I are not going to end up being best of friends. He lives all the way in L.A. and I imagine is quite busy, but through the tools available to me — technology and the innate way that I approach making music — I can sort of bully our existences into a shared event, which is sort of what you saw. I can hear something that I love in a piece of media and I can co-opt it and insert myself in that narrative, or alter it, even.In a nutshell, that's what I was trying to do with these things, but more importantly, that's what the past 30 years of music has been. That's the major thread. See, 30 years ago, you had the first digital samplers, and they changed everything overnight. All of a sudden, artists could sample from anything and everything that came before them, from a snare drum from the Funky Meters, to a Ron Carter bassline, the theme to ""The Price Is Right."" Albums like De La Soul's ""3 Feet High and Rising"" and the Beastie Boys' ""Paul's Boutique"" looted from decades of recorded music to create these sonic, layered masterpieces that were basically the Sgt. Peppers of their day. And they weren't sampling these records because they were too lazy to write their own music. They weren't sampling these records to cash in on the familiarity of the original stuff. To be honest, it was all about sampling really obscure things, except for a few obvious exceptions like Vanilla Ice and ""doo doo doo da da doo doo"" that we know about. But the thing is, they were sampling those records because they heard something in that music that spoke to them that they instantly wanted to inject themselves into the narrative of that music. They heard it, they wanted to be a part of it, and all of a sudden they found themselves in possession of the technology to do so, not much unlike the way the Delta blues struck a chord with the Stones and the Beatles and Clapton, and they felt the need to co-opt that music for the tools of their day. You know, in music we take something that we love and we build on it.I'd like to play a song for you.(Music: ""La Di Da Di"" by Doug E. Fresh & Slick Rick)That's ""La Di Da Di"" and it's the fifth-most sampled song of all time. It's been sampled 547 times. It was made in 1984 by these two legends of hip-hop, Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh, and the Ray-Ban and Jheri curl look is so strong. I do hope that comes back soon.Anyway, this predated the sampling era. There were no samples in this record, although I did look up on the Internet last night, I mean several months ago, that ""La Di Da Di"" means, it's an old Cockney expression from the late 1800s in England, so maybe a remix with Mrs. Patmore from ""Downton Abbey"" coming soon, or that's for another day.Doug E. Fresh was the human beat box. Slick Rick is the voice you hear on the record, and because of Slick Rick's sing-songy, super-catchy vocals, it provides endless sound bites and samples for future pop records.That was 1984. This is me in 1984, in case you were wondering how I was doing, thank you for asking. It's Throwback Thursday already. I was involved in a heavy love affair with the music of Duran Duran, as you can probably tell from my outfit. I was in the middle. And the simplest way that I knew how to co-opt myself into that experience of wanting to be in that song somehow was to just get a band together of fellow nine-year-olds and play ""Wild Boys"" at the school talent show. So that's what we did, and long story short, we were booed off the stage, and if you ever have a chance to live your life escaping hearing the sound of an auditorium full of second- and third-graders booing, I would highly recommend it. It's not really fun. But it didn't really matter, because what I wanted somehow was to just be in the history of that song for a minute. I didn't care who liked it. I just loved it, and I thought I could put myself in there.Over the next 10 years, ""La Di Da Di"" continues to be sampled by countless records, ending up on massive hits like ""Here Comes the Hotstepper"" and ""I Wanna Sex You Up."" Snoop Doggy Dogg covers this song on his debut album ""Doggystyle"" and calls it ""Lodi Dodi."" Copyright lawyers are having a field day at this point. And then you fast forward to 1997, and the Notorious B.I.G., or Biggie, reinterprets ""La Di Da Di"" on his number one hit called ""Hypnotize,"" which I will play a little bit of and I will play you a little bit of the Slick Rick to show you where they got it from.(Music: ""Hypnotize"" by The Notorious B.I.G.)So Biggie was killed weeks before that song made it to number one, in one of the great tragedies of the hip-hop era, but he would have been 13 years old and very much alive when ""La Di Da Di"" first came out, and as a young boy growing up in Brooklyn, it's hard not to think that that song probably held some fond memories for him. But the way he interpreted it, as you hear, is completely his own. He flips it, makes it, there's nothing pastiche whatsoever about it. It's thoroughly modern Biggie. I had to make that joke in this room, because you would be the only people that I'd ever have a chance of getting it. And so, it's a groaner. (Laughter)Elsewhere in the pop and rap world, we're going a little bit sample-crazy. We're getting away from the obscure samples that we were doing, and all of a sudden everyone's taking these massive '80s tunes like Bowie, ""Let's Dance,"" and all these disco records, and just rapping on them. These records don't really age that well. You don't hear them now, because they borrowed from an era that was too steeped in its own connotation. You can't just hijack nostalgia wholesale. It leaves the listener feeling sickly.You have to take an element of those things and then bring something fresh and new to it, which was something that I learned when I was working with the late, amazing Amy Winehouse on her album ""Back to Black."" A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album that myself and Salaam Remi, the other producer, achieved, how we captured this long-lost sound, but without the very, very 21st-century personality and firebrand that was Amy Winehouse and her lyrics about rehab and Roger Moore and even a mention of Slick Rick, the whole thing would have run the risk of being very pastiche, to be honest. Imagine any other singer from that era over it singing the same old lyrics. It runs a risk of being completely bland. I mean, there was no doubt that Amy and I and Salaam all had this love for this gospel, soul and blues and jazz that was evident listening to the musical arrangements. She brought the ingredients that made it urgent and of the time.So if we come all the way up to the present day now, the cultural tour de force that is Miley Cyrus, she reinterprets ""La Di Da Di"" completely for her generation, and we'll take a listen to the Slick Rick part and then see how she sort of flipped it. (Music: ""La Di Da Di"" by Slick Rick & Doug E. Fresh) (Music: ""We Can't Stop"" by Miley Cyrus) So Miley Cyrus, who wasn't even born yet when ""La Di Da Di"" was made, and neither were any of the co-writers on the song, has found this song that somehow etched its way into the collective consciousness of pop music, and now, with its timeless playfulness of the original, has kind of translated to a whole new generation who will probably co-opt it as their own.Since the dawn of the sampling era, there's been endless debate about the validity of music that contains samples. You know, the Grammy committee says that if your song contains some kind of pre-written or pre-existing music, you're ineligible for song of the year. Rockists, who are racist but only about rock music, constantly use the argument to — That's a real word. That is a real word. They constantly use the argument to devalue rap and modern pop, and these arguments completely miss the point, because the dam has burst. We live in the post-sampling era. We take the things that we love and we build on them. That's just how it goes. And when we really add something significant and original and we merge our musical journey with this, then we have a chance to be a part of the evolution of that music that we love and be linked with it once it becomes something new again.So I would like to do one more piece that I put together for you tonight, and it takes place with two pretty inspiring TED performances that I've seen. One of them is the piano player Derek Paravicini, who happens to be a blind, autistic genius at the piano, and Emmanuel Jal, who is an ex-child soldier from the South Sudan, who is a spoken word poet and rapper. And once again I found a way to annoyingly me-me-me myself into the musical history of these songs, but I can't help it, because they're these things that I love, and I want to mess around with them. So I hope you enjoy this. Here we go.Let's hear that TED sound again, right?(Music)Thank you very much. Thank you.(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/mark_ronson_how_sampling_transformed_music

Some of my earliest memories are of giant ships blocking the end of my street, as well as the sun, for a lot of the year. Every morning as a child, I'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill to work in the shipyard. I'd watch those same men walking back home every night. It has to be said, the shipyard was not the most pleasant place to live next door to, or indeed work in. The shipyard was noisy, dangerous, highly toxic, with an appalling health and safety record.Despite that, the men and women who worked on those ships were extraordinarily proud of the work they did, and justifiably so. Some of the largest vessels ever constructed on planet Earth were built right at the end of my street.My grandfather had been a shipwright, and as a child, as there were few other jobs in the town, I would wonder with some anxiety whether that would be my destiny too. I was fairly determined that it wouldn't be. I had other dreams, not necessarily practical ones, but at the age of eight, I was bequeathed a guitar. It was a battered old thing with five rusty strings, and was out of tune, but quickly I learned to play it and realized that I'd found a friend for life, an accomplice, a co-conspirator in my plan to escape from this surreal industrial landscape.Well, they say if you dream something hard enough, it will come to pass. Either that, or I was extremely lucky, but this was my dream. I dreamt I would leave this town, and just like those ships, once they were launched, I'd never come back. I dreamt I'd become a writer of songs, that I would sing those songs to vast numbers of people all over the world, that I would be paid extravagant amounts of money, that I'd become famous, that I'd marry a beautiful woman, have children, raise a family, buy a big house in the country, keep dogs, grow wine, have rooms full of Grammy Awards, platinum discs, and what have you. So far, so good, right? (Laughter)And then one day, the songs stopped coming, and while you've suffered from periods of writer's block before, albeit briefly, this is something chronic. Day after day, you face a blank page, and nothing's coming. And those days turned to weeks, and weeks to months, and pretty soon those months have turned into years with very little to show for your efforts. No songs. So you start asking yourself questions. What have I done to offend the gods that they would abandon me so? Is the gift of songwriting taken away as easily as it seems to have been bestowed? Or perhaps there's a more — a deeper psychological reason. It was always a Faustian pact anyway. You're rewarded for revealing your innermost thoughts, your private emotions on the page for the entertainment of others, for the analysis, the scrutiny of others, and perhaps you've given enough of your privacy away.And yet, if you look at your work, could it be argued that your best work wasn't about you at all, it was about somebody else? Did your best work occur when you sidestepped your own ego and you stopped telling your story, but told someone else's story, someone perhaps without a voice, where empathetically, you stood in his shoes for a while or saw the world through his eyes?Well they say, write what you know. If you can't write about yourself anymore, then who do you write about? So it's ironic that the landscape I'd worked so hard to escape from, and the community that I'd more or less abandoned and exiled myself from should be the very landscape, the very community I would have to return to to find my missing muse.And as soon as I did that, as soon as I decided to honor the community I came from and tell their story, that the songs started to come thick and fast. I've described it as a kind of projectile vomiting, a torrent of ideas, of characters, of voices, of verses, couplets, entire songs almost formed whole, materialized in front of me as if they'd been bottled up inside me for many, many years. One of the first things I wrote was just a list of names of people I'd known, and they become characters in a kind of three-dimensional drama, where they explain who they are, what they do, their hopes and their fears for the future.This is Jackie White. He's the foreman of the shipyard.My name is Jackie White, and I'm foreman of the yard, and you don't mess with Jackie on this quayside. I'm as hard as iron plate, woe betide you if you're late when we have to push a boat out on the spring tide. Now you can die and hope for heaven, but you need to work your shift, and I'd expect you all to back us to the hilt, for if St. Peter at his gate were to ask you why you're late, why, you tell him that you had to get a ship built. We build battleships and cruisersfor Her Majesty the Queen, supertankers for Onassis, and all the classes in between, We built the greatest ship in tonnage what the world has ever seen♪ And the only life worth knowing is in the shipyard ♪♪ Steel in the stockyard, iron in the soul ♪♪ Would conjure up a ship ♪♪ Where there used to be a hull ♪♪ And we don't know what we'll do ♪♪ If this yard gets sold ♪♪ For the only life worth knowing is in the shipyard ♪(Applause)So having decided to write about other people instead of myself, a further irony is that sometimes you reveal more about yourself than you'd ever intended. This song is called ""Dead Man's Boots,"" which is an expression which describes how difficult it is to get a job; in other words, you'd only get a job in the shipyard if somebody else died. Or perhaps your father could finagle you an apprenticeship at the age of 15. But sometimes a father's love can be misconstrued as controlling, and conversely, the scope of his son's ambition can seem like some pie-in-the-sky fantasy. (Music)♪ You see these work boots in my hands ♪♪ They'll probably fit you now, my son ♪♪ Take them, they're a gift from me ♪♪ Why don't you try them on? ♪♪ It would do your old man good to see ♪♪ You walking in these boots one day ♪♪ And take your place among the men ♪♪ Who work upon the slipway ♪♪ These dead man's boots, though they're old and curled ♪♪ When a fellow needs a job and a place in the world ♪♪ And it's time for a man to put down roots ♪♪ And walk to the river in his old man's boots ♪♪ He said, ""I'm dying, son, and asking ♪♪ That you do one final thing for me ♪♪ You're barely but a sapling, and you think that you're a tree ♪♪ If you need a seed to prosper ♪♪ You must first put down some roots ♪♪ Just one foot then the other in ♪♪ These dead man's boots"" ♪♪ These dead man's boots, though they're old and curled ♪♪ When a fellow needs a job and a place in the world ♪♪ And it's time for a man to put down roots ♪♪ And walk to the river in his old man's boots ♪♪ I said, ""Why in the hell would I do that? ♪♪ Why would I agree?"" ♪♪ When his hand was all that I'd received ♪♪ As far as I remember ♪♪ It's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness ♪♪ Up to then, you see ♪♪ I'd a plan of my own and I'd quit this place ♪♪ When I came of age September ♪♪ These dead man's boots know their way down the hill ♪♪ They could walk there themselves, and they probably will ♪♪ I've plenty of choices, I've plenty other routes ♪♪ And you'll never see me walking in these dead man's boots ♪♪ What was it made him think ♪♪ I'd be happy ending up like him ♪♪ When he'd hardly got two halfpennies left ♪♪ Or a broken pot to piss in? ♪♪ He wanted this same thing for me ♪♪ Was that his final wish? ♪♪ He said, ""What the hell are you gonna do?"" ♪♪ I said, ""Anything but this!"" ♪♪ These dead man's boots know their way down the hill ♪♪ They can walk there themselves and they probably will ♪♪ But they won't walk with me ‘cause I'm off the other way ♪♪ I've had it up to here, I'm gonna have my say ♪♪ When all you've got left is that cross on the wall ♪♪ I want nothing from you, I want nothing at all ♪♪ Not a pension, nor a pittance, when your whole life is through ♪♪ Get this through your head, I'm nothing like you ♪♪ I'm done with all the arguments, there'll be no more disputes ♪♪ And you'll die before you see me in your dead man's boots ♪(Applause)Thank you.So whenever they'd launch a big ship, they would invite some dignitary up from London on the train to make a speech, break a bottle of champagne over the bows, launch it down the slipway into the river and out to sea. Occasionally on a really important ship, they'd get a member of the royal family to come, Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Anne or somebody. And you have to remember, it wasn't that long ago that the royal family in England were considered to have magical healing powers. Sick children were held up in crowds to try and touch the cloak of the king or the queen to cure them of some terrible disease. It wasn't like that in my day, but we still got very excited.So it's a launch day, it's a Saturday, and my mother has dressed me up in my Sunday best. I'm not very happy with her. All the kids are out in the street, and we have little Union Jacks to wave, and at the top of the hill, there's a motorcycle cortege appears. In the middle of the motorcycles, there's a big, black Rolls-Royce. Inside the Rolls-Royce is the Queen Mother. This is a big deal. So the procession is moving at a stately pace down my street, and as it approaches my house, I start to wave my flag vigorously, and there is the Queen Mother. I see her, and she seems to see me. She acknowledges me. She waves, and she smiles. And I wave my flag even more vigorously. We're having a moment, me and the Queen Mother. She's acknowledged me. And then she's gone.Well, I wasn't cured of anything. It was the opposite, actually. I was infected. I was infected with an idea. I don't belong in this street. I don't want to live in that house. I don't want to end up in that shipyard. I want to be in that car. (Laughter) I want a bigger life. I want a life beyond this town. I want a life that's out of the ordinary. It's my right. It's my right as much as hers. And so here I am at TED, I suppose to tell that story, and I think it's appropriate to say the obvious that there's a symbiotic and intrinsic link between storytelling and community, between community and art, between community and science and technology, between community and economics. It's my belief that abstract economic theory that denies the needs of community or denies the contribution that community makes to economy is shortsighted, cruel and untenable.(Applause)The fact is, whether you're a rock star or whether you're a welder in a shipyard, or a tribesman in the upper Amazon, or the queen of England, at the end of the day, we're all in the same boat.♪ Aye, the footmen are frantic in their indignation ♪♪ You see the queen's took a taxi herself to the station ♪♪ Where the porters, surprised by her lack of royal baggage ♪♪ Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage ♪♪ For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility ♪♪ And there's none of them famous for their compatibility ♪♪ There's a fight over seats ♪♪ ""I beg pardon, Your Grace ♪♪ But you'll find that one's mine, so get back in your place!"" ♪♪ ""Aye, but where are they going?"" ♪♪ All the porters debate ♪♪ ""Why they're going to Newcastle and they daren't be late ♪♪ For they're launching a boat on the Tyne at high tide ♪♪ And they've come from all over, from far and from wide"" ♪♪ There's the old Dalai Lama ♪♪ And the pontiff of Rome ♪♪ Every palace in Europe, and there's nay bugger home ♪♪ There's the Duchess of Cornwall and the loyal Prince of Wales ♪♪ Looking crushed and uncomfortable in his top hat and tails ♪♪ Well, they haven't got tickets ♪♪ Come now, it's just a detail ♪♪ There was no time to purchase and one simply has to prevail ♪♪ For we'll get to the shipyards or we'll end up in jail! ♪♪ When the last ship sails ♪♪ Oh the roar of the chains ♪♪ And the cracking of timbers ♪♪ The noise at the end of the world in your ears ♪♪ As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea ♪♪ And the last ship sails ♪♪ And whatever you'd promised ♪♪ Whatever you've done ♪♪ And whatever the station in life you've become ♪♪ In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son ♪♪ And no matter the weave of this life that you've spun ♪♪ On the Earth or in Heaven or under the Sun ♪♪ When the last ship sails ♪♪ Oh the roar of the chains ♪♪ And the cracking of timbers ♪♪ The noise at the end of the world in your ears ♪♪ As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea ♪♪ And the last ship sails ♪Thanks very much for listening to my song.

"I want to talk to you about one thing and just one thing only, and this has to do with when people ask me, what do you do? To which I usually respond, I do computer music.Now, a number of people just stop talking to me right then and there, and the rest who are left usually have this blank look in their eye, as if to say, what does that mean? And I feel like I'm actually depriving them of information by telling them this, at which point I usually panic and spit out the first thing that comes to my mind, which is, I have no idea what I'm doing. Which is true. That's usually followed by a second thought, which is, whatever it is that I'm doing, I love it. And today, I want to, well, share with you something I love, and also why.And I think we'll begin with just this question: What is computer music? And I'm going to try to do my best to provide a definition, maybe by telling you a story that goes through some of the stuff I've been working on.And the first thing, I think, in our story is going to be something called ChucK. Now, ChucK is a programming language for music, and it's open-source, it's freely available, and I like to think that it crashes equally well on all modern operating systems. And instead of telling you more about it, I'm just going to give you a demo. By the way, I'm just going to nerd out for just a few minutes here, so I would say, don't freak out. In fact, I would invite all of you to join me in just geeking out. If you've never written a line of code before in your life, do not worry. I'll bet you'll be able to come along on this.First thing I'm going to do is to make a sine wave oscillator, and we're going to called the sine wave generator ""Ge."" And then we're going to connect ""Ge"" to the DAC. Now this is kind of the abstraction for the sound output on my computer. Okay? So I've connected myself into the speaker. Next, I'm going to say my frequency is 440 hertz, and I'm going to let time advance by two seconds through this operation. All right, so if I were to play this — (Tone) — you would hear a sine wave at 440 hertz for two seconds. Okay, great. Now I'm going to copy and paste this, and then just change some of these numbers, 220.5, 440 I shall leave it as that, and .5 and 880. By doubling the frequency, we're actually going up in successive octaves, and then we have this sequence — (Tones) — of tones. Okay, great, now I can imagine creating all kinds of really horrible single sine wave pieces of music with this, but I'm going to do something that computers are really good at, which is repetition. I'm going to put this all in a while loop, and you actually don't need to indent, but this is purely for aesthetic reasons. It's good practice. And when we do this — (Tones) — that's going to go on for a while. In fact, it's probably not going to stop until this computer disintegrates. And I can't really empirically prove that to you, but I hope you'll believe me when I say that. Next, I'm going to replace this 220 by math.random2f. I'm going to generate a random number between 30 and 1,000 and send that to the frequency of me. And I'm going to do this every half a second. (Tones) Let's do this every 200 milliseconds. (Tones) One hundred. (Tones) All right. At this point, we've reached something that I would like to think of as the canonical computer music. This is, to me, the sound that mainframes are supposed to be making when they're thinking really hard. It's this sound, it's like, the square root of five million.So is this computer music? Yeah, I guess by definition, it's kind of computer music. It's probably not the kind of music you would listen to cruising down the highway, but it's a foundation of computer-generated music, and using ChucK, we've actually been building instruments in the Stanford Laptop Orchestra, based right here at Stanford Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics.Now the Laptop Orchestra is an ensemble of laptops, humans and special hemispherical speaker arrays. Now the reason we have these is so that for the instruments that we create out of the laptop, we want the sound to come out of somewhere near the instrument and the performer, kind of much like a traditional, acoustic instrument. Like, if I were to play a violin here, the sound would naturally not come out of the P.A. system, but from the artifact itself. So these speakers are meant to emulate that. In fact, I'm going to show you how we actually built them. The first step is to go to IKEA and buy a salad bowl. This is an 11-inch Blanda Matt. That's the actual name, and I actually use one of these to make salad at home as well, I kid you not. And the first step is you turn it upside down, and then you drill holes in them, six holes per hemi, and then make a base plate, put car speaker drivers in them along with amplifiers in the enclosure, and you put that all together and you have these hemispherical speaker arrays. Add people, add laptops, you have a laptop orchestra.And what might a laptop orchestra sound like? Well, let me give you a demonstration of about 200 instruments we've created so far for the Laptop Orchestra. And what I'm going to do is actually come over to this thing. This thing I have in front of me actually used to be a commodity gaming controller called a Gametrak. This thing actually has a glove you can put on your hands. It's tethered to the base, and this will track the position of your hands in real time. It was originally designed as a golfing controller to detect the motion of your swing. That turned out to be a rather large commercial non-success, at which point they slashed prices to 10 dollars, at which point computer music researchers said, ""This is awesome! We can prototype instruments out of this.""So let me show you one instrument we've created, one of many, and this instrument is called ""Twilight,"" and it's meant to go with this metaphor of pulling a sound out of the ground. So let me see if this will work.(Music)And put it back. And then if you go to the left, right, it sounds like an elephant in pain.This is a slightly metallic sound. Turn it just a bit.(Music) It's like a hovering car.Okay.This third one is a ratchet-like interaction, so let me turn it up.(Music)So it's a slightly different interaction.The fourth one is a drone.(Music) And finally, let's see, this is a totally different interaction, and I think you have to imagine that there's this giant invisible drum sitting right here on stage, and I'm going to bang it. (Drum) (Laughter) So there we go, so that's one of many instruments in the Laptop Orchestra.(Applause)Thank you.And when you put that together, you get something that sounds like this.(Music)Okay, and so, I think from the experience of building a lot of instruments for the Laptop Orchestra, and I think from the curiosity of wondering, what if we took these hopefully expressive instruments and we brought it to a lot of people, plus then a healthy bout of insanity — put those three things together — led to me actually co-founding a startup company in 2008 called Smule.Now Smule's mission is to create expressive, mobile music things, and one of the first musical instruments we created is called Ocarina. And I'm going to just demo this for you real quick. So Ocarina — (Music) — is based on this ancient flute-like instrument called the ocarina, and this one is the four-hole English pendant configuration, and you're literally blowing into the microphone to make the sound. And there's actually a little ChucK script running in here that's detecting the strength of your blowing and also synthesizing the sound. (Music) And vibrato is mapped to the accelerometer, so you can get — (Music) All right. So let me play a little ditty for you, a little Bach. And here, you'll hear a little accompaniment with the melody. The accompaniment actually follows the melody, not the other way around.(Music)And this was designed to let you take your time and figure out where your expressive space is, and you can just hang out here for a while, for a really dramatic effect, if you want, and whenever you're ready —(Music)And on these longer notes, I'm going to use more vibrato towards the end of the notes to give it a little bit more of an expressive quality.(Music)Huh, that's a nice chord to end this excerpt on.(Applause)Thank you.So I think a good question to ask about Ocarina is, is this a toy or it an instrument? Maybe it's both, but for me, I think the more important question is, is it expressive? And at the same time, I think creating these types of instruments asks a question about the role of technology, and its place for how we make music. Apparently, for example, not that long ago, like only a hundred years ago — that's not that long in the course of human history — families back then used to make music together as a common form of entertainment. I don't think that's really happening that much anymore. You know, this is before radio, before recording. In the last hundred years, with all this technology, we now have more access to music as listeners and consumers, but somehow, I think we're making less music than ever before. I'm not sure why that would be. Maybe it's because it's too easy just to hit play. And while listening to music is wonderful, there's a special joy to making music that's all its own. And I think that's one part of the goal of why I do what I do is kind of to take us back to the past a little bit. Right?Now, if that's one goal, the other goal is to look to the future and think about what kind of new musical things can we make that we don't perhaps yet have names for that's enabled by technology, but ultimately might change the way that humans make music. And I'll just give you one example here, and this is Ocarina's other feature. This is a globe, and here you're actually listening to other users of Ocarina blow into their iPhones to play something. This is ""G.I.R."" from Texas, ""R.I.K."" I don't know why it's these three-letter names today, Los Angeles. They're all playing pretty, somewhat minimal music here.(Music)And the idea with this is that, well, technology should not be foregrounded here, and — (Laughter) — we've actually opened this up. The first thought is that, hey, you know there's somebody somewhere out there playing some music, and this is a small but I think important human connection to make that perhaps the technology affords.As a final example, and perhaps my favorite example, is that in the wake of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan, a woman reached out in one of our singing apps to try to get people to join in to sing with her on a version of ""Lean on Me."" Now, in these apps, there's this thing that allows any user to add their voice to an existing performance by any other user or group of users, so in some sense, she's created this kind of global ad hoc corral of strangers, and within weeks, thousands of people joined in on this, and you can kind of see people coming from all around the world and all these lines converging on the origin where the first rendition of the song was sung, and that's in Tokyo. And this is what it sounds like  when there's 1,000 people. This is 1,000 voices.(Recording) ♪ Sometimes in our lives ♪♪ We all have pain, we all have sorrow ♪♪ But if we are wise ♪♪ We know that there's always tomorrow ♪♪ Lean on me ♪♪ When you're not strong ♪♪ And I'll be your friend ♪♪ I'll help you carry on ♪♪ For it won't be long ♪♪ Till I'm gonna need ♪♪ Somebody to lean on ♪♪ Just lean on — ♪Is this computer music?(Applause)Was that computer music? Yeah, I guess so; it's something that you really couldn't have done without computers. But at the same time, it's also just human, and I think what I've essentially answered so far is maybe why I do the stuff that I do, and let's just finally return to the first question: What is computer music? And I think that the catch here is that, at least to me, computer music isn't really about computers. It is about people. It's about how we can use technology to change the way we think and do and make music, and maybe even add to how we can connect with each other through music.And with that, I want to say, this is computer music, and thank you for listening.(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/ge_wang_the_diy_orchestra_of_the_future

"I didn't know when I agreed to do this whether I was expected to talk or to sing. But when I was told that the topic was language, I felt that I had to speak about something for a moment.I have a problem. It's not the worst thing in the world. I'm fine. I'm not on fire. I know that other people in the world have far worse things to deal with, but for me, language and music are inextricably linked through this one thing.And the thing is that I have a stutter. It might seem curious given that I spend a lot of my life on the stage. One would assume that I'm comfortable in the public sphere and comfortable here, speaking to you guys. But the truth is that I've spent my life up until this point and including this point, living in mortal dread of public speaking. Public singing, whole different thing. (Laughter) But we'll get to that in a moment. I've never really talked about it before so explicitly. I think that that's because I've always lived in hope that when I was a grown-up, I wouldn't have one. I sort of lived with this idea that when I'm grown, I'll have learned to speak French, and when I'm grown, I'll learn how to manage my money, and when I'm grown, I won't have a stutter, and then I'll be able to public speak and maybe be the prime minister and anything's possible and, you know. (Laughter) So I can talk about it now because I've reached this point, where — I mean, I'm 28. I'm pretty sure that I'm grown now. (Laughter) And I'm an adult woman who spends her life as a performer, with a speech impediment. So, I might as well come clean about it.There are some interesting angles to having a stutter. For me, the worst thing that can happen is meeting another stutterer. (Laughter) This happened to me in Hamburg, when this guy, we met and he said, ""Hello, m-m-m-my name is Joe,"" and I said, ""Oh, hello, m-m-m-my name is Meg."" Imagine my horror when I realized he thought I was making fun of him. (Laughter)People think I'm drunk all the time. (Laughter)People think that I've forgotten their name when I hesitate before saying it. And it is a very weird thing, because proper nouns are the worst. If I'm going to use the word ""Wednesday"" in a sentence, and I'm coming up to the word, and I can feel that I'm going to stutter or something, I can change the word to ""tomorrow,"" or ""the day after Tuesday,"" or something else. It's clunky, but you can get away with it, because over time I've developed this loophole method of using speech where right at the last minute you change the thing and you trick your brain. But with people's names, you can't change them. (Laughter) When I was singing a lot of jazz, I worked a lot with a pianist whose name was Steve. As you can probably gather, S's and T's, together or independently, are my kryptonite. But I would have to introduce the band over this rolling vamp, and when I got around to Steve, I'd often find myself stuck on the ""St."" And it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable  and it totally kills the vibe. So after a few instances of this, Steve happily became ""Seve,"" and we got through it that way. (Laughter)I've had a lot of therapy, and a common form of treatment is to use this technique that's called smooth speech, which is where you almost sing everything that you say. You kind of join everything together in this very singsong, kindergarten teacher way, and it makes you sound very serene, like you've had lots of Valium, and everything is calm. (Laughter) That's not actually me. And I do use that. I do. I use it when I have to be on panel shows, or when I have to do radio interviews, when the economy of airtime is paramount. (Laughter) I get through it that way for my job. But as an artist who feels that their work is based solely on a platform of honesty and being real, that feels often like cheating.Which is why before I sing, I wanted to tell you what singing means to me. It's more than making nice sounds, and it's more than making nice songs. It's more than feeling known, or understood. It's more than making you feel the things that I feel. It's not about mythology, or mythologizing myself to you. Somehow, through some miraculous synaptic function of the human brain, it's impossible to stutter when you sing. And when I was younger, that was a method of treatment that worked very well for me, singing, so I did it a lot. And that's why I'm here today.(Applause)Thank you.Singing for me is sweet relief. It is the only time when I feel fluent. It is the only time when what comes out of my mouth is comprehensively exactly what I intended. (Laughter) So I know that this is a TED Talk, but now i'm going to TED sing. This is a song that I wrote last year.Thank you very much.

"Recently, I flew over a crowd of thousands of people in Brazil playing music by George Frideric Handel. I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam, again playing music by this same composer. Let's take a look.(Music: George Frideric Handel, ""Allegro."" Performed by Daria van den Bercken.)(Video) Daria van den Bercken: I live there on the third floor. (In Dutch) I live there on the corner. I actually live there, around the corner. and you'd be really welcome.Man: (In Dutch) Does that sound like fun? Child: (In Dutch) Yes![(In Dutch) ""Handel house concert""](Applause)Daria van den Bercken: All this was a real magical experience for hundreds of reasons.Now you may ask, why have I done these things? They're not really typical for a musician's day-to-day life. Well, I did it because I fell in love with the music and I wanted to share it with as many people as possible.It started a couple of years ago. I was sitting at home on the couch with the flu and browsing the Internet a little, when I found out that Handel had written works for the keyboard. Well, I was surprised. I did not know this. So I downloaded the sheet music and started playing. And what happened next was that I entered this state of pure, unprejudiced amazement. It was an experience of being totally in awe of the music, and I had not felt that in a long time. It might be easier to relate to this when you hear it. The first piece that I played through started like this.(Music)Well this sounds very melancholic, doesn't it? And I turned the page and what came next was this.(Music)Well, this sounds very energetic, doesn't it? So within a couple of minutes, and the piece isn't even finished yet, I experienced two very contrasting characters: beautiful melancholy and sheer energy. And I consider these two elements to be vital human expressions. And the purity of the music makes you hear it very effectively.I've given a lot of children's concerts for children of seven and eight years old, and whatever I play, whether it's Bach, Beethoven, even Stockhausen, or some jazzy music, they are open to hear it, really willing to listen, and they are comfortable doing so. And when classes come in with children who are just a few years older, 11, 12, I felt that I sometimes already had trouble in reaching them like that. The complexity of the music does become an issue, and actually the opinions of others — parents, friends, media — they start to count. But the young ones, they don't question their own opinion. They are in this constant state of wonder, and I do firmly believe that we can keep listening like these seven-year-old children, even when growing up. And that is why I have played not only in the concert hall but also on the street, online, in the air: to feel that state of wonder, to truly listen, and to listen without prejudice. And I would like to invite you to do so now. (Music: George Frideric Handel, ""Chaconne in G Major."" Performed by Daria van den Bercken.)(Applause) Thank you.

"Vincent Moon: How can we use computers, cameras, microphones to represent the world in an alternative way, as much as possible? How, maybe, is it possible to use the Internet to create a new form of cinema? And actually, why do we record?Well, it is with such simple questions in mind that I started to make films 10 years ago, first with a friend, Christophe Abric. He had a website, La Blogothèque, dedicated to independent music. We were crazy about music. We wanted to represent  music in a different way, to film the music we love, the musicians we admired, as much as possible, far  from the music industry and far from the cliches attached to it. We started to publish every week sessions on the Internet. We are going to see a few extracts now.From Grizzly Bear in the shower to Sigur Ros playing in a Parisian cafe. From Phoenix playing by the Eiffel Tower to Tom Jones in his  hotel room in New York. From Arcade Fire in an elevator in the Olympia to Beirut going down a staircase in Brooklyn. From R.E.M. in a car to The National around a table at night in the south of France. From Bon Iver playing with some friends in an apartment in Montmartre to Yeasayer having a long night, and many, many, many more unknown or very famous bands.We published all those films for free on the Internet, and we wanted to share all those films and represent music in a different way. We wanted to create  another type of intimacy using all those new technologies. At the time, 10 years ago actually, there was no such project on the Internet, and I guess that's why the project we  were making, the Take Away Shows, got quite successful, reaching millions of viewers.After a while, I got a bit — I wanted to go somewhere else. I felt the need to travel and to discover some other music, to explore the world, going to other corners, and actually it was also this idea of nomadic cinema, sort of, that I had in mind. How could the use of new technologies  and the road fit together? How could I edit my films in a bus crossing the Andes? So I went on five-year travels around the globe. I started at the time in the digital film  and music label collection Petites Planètes, which was also an homage to French filmmaker Chris Marker. We're going to see now a few more extracts of those new films.From the tecno brega diva of northern Brazil, Gaby Amarantos to a female ensemble in Chechnya. From experimental electronic music  in Singapore with One Man Nation to Brazilian icon Tom Zé singing on his rooftop in São Paolo. From The Bambir, the great  rock band from Armenia to some traditional songs in a restaurant in Tbilisi, Georgia. From White Shoes, a great retro  pop band from Jakarta, Indonesia to DakhaBrakha, the revolutionary  band from Kiev, Ukraine. From Tomi Lebrero and his bandoneon and his friends in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to many other places and musicians around the world.My desire was to make it as a trek. To do all those films, it would have been impossible with a big company behind me, with a structure or anything. I was traveling alone with a backpack — computer, camera, microphones in it. Alone, actually, but  just with local people, meeting my team, which was absolutely not professional people, on the spot there, going from one place to another and to make cinema as a trek. I really believed that cinema could be this very simple thing: I want to make a film and you're going  to give me a place to stay for the night. I give you a moment of cinema and you offer me a capirinha. Well, or other drinks, depending on where you are.In Peru, they drink pisco sour. Well, when I arrived in Peru, actually, I had no idea about what I would do there. And I just had one phone number, actually, of one person. Three months later, after traveling all around the  country, I had recorded 33 films, only with the help of local people, only with the help of people that I was asking all the  time the same question: What is important to record here today? By living in such a way, by working without any structure, I was able to react to the moment and to decide, oh, this is  important to make now. This is important to  record that whole person. This is important to create this exchange. When I went to Chechnya, the first person I met looked at me and was like, ""What are you doing here? Are you a journalist? NGO? Politics? What kind of problems  are you going to study?"" Well, I was there to research on Sufi rituals in Chechnya, actually — incredible culture of Sufism in Chechnya, which is absolutely unknown  outside of the region. As soon as people understood that I would give them those films — I would publish them online for free under a Creative Commons license, but I would also really  give them to the people and I would let them do  what they want with it. I just want to represent  them in a beautiful light. I just want to portray them in a way that their grandchildren are going to look at their grandfather, and they're going to be like, ""Whoa, my grandfather is as  cool as Beyoncé."" (Laughter) It's a really important thing. (Applause)It's really important, because that's the way people are going to look differently at  their own culture, at their own land. They're going to think about it differently. It may be a way to maintain  a certain diversity. Why you will record? Hmm. There's a really good quote by American thinker Hakim Bey which says, ""Every recording is a tombstone of a live performance."" It's a really good  sentence to keep in mind nowadays in an era saturated by images. What's the point of that? Where do we go with it? I was researching. I was still  keeping this idea in mind: What's the point? I was researching on music, trying to pull, trying to get closer to a certain origin of it. Where is this all coming from? I am French. I had no idea about what I would discover,  which is a very simple thing: Everything was sacred, at first, and music was spiritual healing. How could I use my camera, my little tool, to get closer and maybe not only capture the trance but find an equivalent,  a cine-trance, maybe, something in complete harmony with the people?That is now my new research I'm doing on spirituality, on new  spirits around the world. Maybe a few more extracts now. From the Tana Toraja  funeral ritual in Indonesia to an Easter ceremony  in the north of Ethiopia. From jathilan, a popular trance ritual on the island of Java, to Umbanda in the north of Brazil. The Sufi rituals of Chechnya to a mass in the holiest  church of Armenia. Some Sufi songs in Harar, the holy city of Ethiopia, to an ayahuasca ceremony deep in the Amazon of  Peru with the Shipibo. Then to my new project,  the one I'm doing now here in Brazil, named ""Híbridos."" I'm doing it with Priscilla Telmon. It's research on the new  spiritualities all around the country. This is my quest, my own little quest  of what I call experimental ethnography, trying to hybrid all  those different genres, trying to regain a certain complexity.Why do we record? I was still there. I really believe cinema teaches us to see. The way we show the world is going to change the  way we see this world, and we live in a moment where the mass media are doing a terrible, terrible job at representing the world: violence, extremists, only spectacular events, only simplifications of everyday life. I think we are recording to regain a certain complexity. To reinvent life today, we have to make new forms of images. And it's very simple.Muito obrigado.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Vincent, Vincent, Vincent. Merci. We have to prepare for the following performance, and I have a question for you, and the question is this: You show up in places like the  ones you just have shown us, and you are carrying a camera and I assume that you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome. You walk into sacred rituals, private moments in a village, a town, a group of people. How do you break the barrier when you show up with a lens?VM: I think you break it with your body, more than with your knowledge. That's what it taught me to travel, to trust the memory of the body more than the memory of the brain. The respect is stepping forward, not stepping backward, and I really think that by engaging your body in the moment, in the ceremony, in the places, people welcome you and understand your energy.BG: You told me that most of the videos you have made are  actually one single shot. You don't do much editing. I mean, you edited the ones for us at the beginning of the sessions because of the length, etc. Otherwise, you just go in and capture whatever happens in front of your eyes without much planning, and so is that the case? It's correct?VM: My idea is that I think that as long as we don't cut, in a way, as long as we let the viewer watch, more and more viewers  are going to feel closer, are going to get closer to the moment, to that moment and to that place. I really think of that as a matter  of respecting the viewer, to not cut all the time from one place to another, to just let the time go.BG: Tell me in a few words  about your new project, ""Híbridos,"" here in Brazil. Just before coming to  TEDGlobal, you have actually been traveling around  the country for that. Tell us a couple of things.VM: ""Híbridos"" is —  I really believe Brazil, far from the cliches, is the greatest religious country in the world, the greatest country  in terms of spirituality and in experimentations in spiritualities. And it's a big project I'm  doing over this year, which is researching in very different regions of Brazil, in very different forms of cults, and trying to understand  how people live together with spirituality nowadays.BG: The man who is going to  appear onstage momentarily, and Vincent's going to introduce him, is one of the subjects of  one of his past videos. When did you do a video with him?VM: I guess four years ago, four years in my first travel.BG: So it was one of  your first ones in Brazil. VM: It was amongst the  first ones in Brazil, yeah. I shot the film in Recife, in the place where he is from.BG: So let's introduce him.  Who are we waiting for?VM: I'll just make it very short. It's a very great honor for  me to welcome onstage one of the greatest Brazilian  musicians of all time.

"In June of 1998, Tori Murden McClure left Nags Head, North Carolina for France.That's her boat, the American Pearl. It's 23 feet long and just six feet across at its widest point. The deck was the size of a cargo bed of a Ford F-150 pickup truck. Tori and her friends built it by hand, and it weighed about 1,800 pounds. Her plan was to row it alone across the Atlantic Ocean — no motor, no sail — something no woman and no American had ever done before. This would be her route: over 3,600 miles across the open North Atlantic Ocean.Professionally, Tori worked as a project administrator for the city of Louisville, Kentucky, her hometown, but her real passion was exploring. This was not her first big expedition. Several years earlier, she'd become the first woman to ski to the South Pole. She was an accomplished rower in college, even competed for a spot on the 1992 U.S. Olympic team, but this, this was different.(Video) (Music) Tori Murden McClure: Hi. It's Sunday, July 5. Sector time 9 a.m. So that's Kentucky time now.Dawn Landes: Tori made these videos as she rowed. This is her 21st day at sea. At this point, she'd covered over 1,000 miles, had had no radio contact in more than two weeks following a storm that disabled all her long-range communications systems just five days in. Most days looked like this. At this point, she'd rowed over 200,000 strokes, fighting the current and the wind. Some days, she traveled as little as 15 feet. Yeah. And as frustrating as those days were, other days were like this.(Video) TMM: And I want to show you my little friends.DL: She saw fish, dolphins, whales, sharks, and even some sea turtles. After two weeks with no human contact, Tori was able to contact a local cargo ship via VHF radio.(Video) TMM: Do you guys have a weather report, over?Man: Heading up to a low ahead of you but it's heading, and you're obviously going northeast and there's a high behind us. That'd be coming east-northeast also.TMM: Good.DL: She's pretty happy to talk to another human at this point.(Video) TMM: So weather report says nothing dramatic is going to happen soon.DL: What the weather report didn't tell her was that she was rowing right into the path of Hurricane Danielle in the worst hurricane season on record in the North Atlantic.(Video) TMM: Just sprained my ankle. There's a very strong wind from the east now. It's blowing about. It's blowing! After 12 days of storm I get to row for four hours without a flagging wind. I'm not very happy right now. As happy as I was this morning, I am unhappy now, so ...DL: After nearly three months at sea, she'd covered over 3,000 miles. She was two thirds of the way there, but in the storm, the waves were the size of a seven-story building. Her boat kept capsizing. Some of them were pitchpole capsizes, flipping her end over end, and rowing became impossible.(Video) TMM: It's 6:30 a.m. I'm in something big, bad and ugly. Two capsizes. Last capsize, I took the rib off the top of my ceiling with my back. I've had about six capsizes now. The last one was a pitchpole. I have the Argus beacon with me. I would set off the distress signal, but quite frankly, I don't think they'd ever be able to find this little boat. It's so far underwater right now, the only part that's showing pretty much is the cabin. It's about 10 a.m. I've lost track of the number of capsizes. I seem to capsize about every 15 minutes. I think I may have broken my left arm. The waves are tearing the boat to shreds. I keep praying because I'm not sure I'm going to make it through this. DL: Tori set off her distress beacon and was rescued by a passing container ship. They found her abandoned boat two months later adrift near France. I read about it in the newspaper.In 1998, I was a high school student living in Louisville, Kentucky. Now, I live in New York City. I'm a songwriter. And her bravery stuck with me, and I'm adapting her story into a musical called ""Row."" When Tori returned home, she was feeling disheartened, she was broke. She was having a hard time making the transition back into civilization.In this scene, she sits at home. The phone is ringing, her friends are calling, but she doesn't know how to talk to them. She sings this song. It's called ""Dear Heart.""(Guitar)When I was dreaming,I took my bodyto beautiful placesI'd never been.I saw Gibraltar,and stars of Kentuckyburned in the moonlight,making me smile.And when I awoke here,the sky was so cloudy.I walked to a partywhere people I knowtry hard to know meand ask where I've been,but I can't explainwhat I've seen to them.Ah, listen, dear heart.Just pay attention,go right from the start.Ah, listen, dear heart.You can fall off the map,but don't fall apart.Ooh ooh ooh,ah ah ah ah ah.Ah ah,ah ah ah.When I was out there,the ocean would hold me,rock me and throw me,light as a child.But now I'm so heavy,nothing consoles me.My mind floats like driftwood,wayward and wild.Ah, listen, dear heart.Just pay attention,go right from the start.Ah, listen, dear heart.You can fall off the map,but don't fall apart.Ooh.Eventually, Tori starts to get her feet under her. She starts hanging out with her friends again. She meets a guy and falls in love for the first time. She gets a new job working for another Louisville native, Muhammad Ali. One day, at lunch with her new boss, Tori shares the news that two other women are setting out to row across the mid-Atlantic, to do something that she almost died trying to do.His response was classic Ali: ""You don't want to go through life as the woman who almost rowed across the ocean.""He was right. Tori rebuilt the American Pearl, and in December of 1999, she did it.(Applause) (Guitar)Thank you.(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/dawn_landes_a_song_for_my_hero_the_woman_who_rowed_into_a_hurricane

What you would have is that, when we would go to parties, you would have the DJ and you would have the rapper. But because I don't have electricity coming out of me, we had to emulate what the beats was doing. So when you would see the beatboxer, you would see us over to the side. Then you would see a rapper, and when the rapper began to rap, we would do a simple beat, because back then the beats were simple —(Beatboxing)or —(Beatboxing)Those were simple beats.

"At Free America, we've done a listening and learning tour. We visited not only with prosecutors but with legislators, with inmates in our state and local prisons. We've gone to immigration detention centers. We've met a lot of people. And we've seen that redemption and transformation can happen in our prisons, our jails and our immigration detention centers, giving hope to those who want to create a better life after serving their time.Imagine if we also considered the front end of this prison pipeline. What would it look like if we intervened, with rehabilitation as a core value — with love and compassion as core values? We would have a society that is safer, healthier and worthy of raising our children in.I want to introduce you to James Cavitt. James served 12 years in the San Quentin State Prison and is being released in 18 months. Now James, like you and me, is more than the worst thing he's done. He is a father, a husband, a son, a poet. He committed a crime; he's paying his debt, and working hard to build the skills to make the transition back to a productive life when he enters the civilian population again.Now James, like millions of people behind bars, is an example of what happens if we believe that our failings don't define who we are, that we are all worthy of redemption and if we support those impacted by mass incarceration, we can all heal together.I'd like to introduce you to James right now, and he's going to share his journey of redemption through spoken word.James Cavitt: Thanks, John. TED, welcome to San Quentin. The talent is abundant behind prison walls. Future software engineers, entrepreneurs, craftsmen, musicians and artists. This piece is inspired by all of the hard work that men and women are doing on the inside to create better lives and futures for themselves after they serve their time.This piece is entitled, ""Where I Live.""I live in a world where most people are too afraid to go. Surrounded by tall, concrete walls, steel bars, where razor wire have a way of cutting away at the hopes for a brighter tomorrow.I live in a world that kill people who kill people in order to teach people that killing people is wrong. Imagine that.Better yet, imagine a world where healed people helped hurt people heal and become strong. Maybe then we would all be singin' ""Redemption Song.""I live in a world that has been called ""hell on Earth"" by those trapped inside. But I've come to the stark realization that prison — it really is what you make it. You see, in spite of the harshness of my reality, there is a silver lining. I knew that my freedom was gonna come, it was just a matter of time. And so I treated my first steps as if they were my last mile, and I realized that you don't have to be free in order to experience freedom.And just because you're free, doesn't mean that you have freedom. Many of us, for years, have been battling our inner demons. We walk around smiling when inside we're really screamin': freedom!Don't you get it? We're all serving time; we're just in different places. As for me, I choose to be free from the prisons I've created. The key: forgiveness. Action's my witness. If we want freedom, then we gotta think different. Because freedom ... it isn't a place. It's a mind setting.Thank you.(Applause)(Piano)John Legend: Old pirates, yes, they rob I. Sold I to the merchant ships. Minutes after they took I from the bottomless pit.My hands were made strong by the hand of the almighty. We forward in this generation triumphantly.Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom? 'Cause all I ever had — redemption songs. Redemption songs.Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery. None but ourselves can free our minds. Have no fear for atomic energy 'cause none of them can stop the time.How long shall they kill our prophets while we stand aside and look?

"I'm going to tell you the story of a song. I was in Madrid one night in 2002 with my teacher and friend Joaquín Sabina, when he said he had something to give me. He said, ""Jorge, I have some lines that you need to put into a song. Take these down, take these down."" I looked on the table but all I found was a circular coaster, on which I wrote the lines my teacher dictated. They were four lines that went like this:""I am a Jewish Moor living among Christians I don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are.""Those lines really made an impression on me. I said, ""What beautiful lyrics, Joaquín. Did you write them?"" He said no, they were by another composer named Chicho Sánchez Ferlosio, who was less known than Joaquín, but also a great poet. These lines came to me at a time where I had been wanting to express something for a while, but didn't quite know how.I was getting up to leave and go home to write, when Joaquín stopped me and said, ""Hang on, hang on,"" and presented me with this challenge: ""Write the stanzas for this song in Décimas."" Now, at this point in my life, I still wasn't completely sure what Décimas were, but I was too embarrassed to tell my teacher I didn't know. So I put on my best ""Yeah, I totally understand"" face, and went home to look up what Décimas were. I learned that a Décima is a type of verse that only exists in Spanish, and that it has 10 lines. It's very, very complex — perhaps the most complex style of stanza that we have in Spanish. It also has a very concrete date of origin, which is very rare for a style of stanza.The Décima was invented in Spain in 1591, by a guy named Vicente Espinel, a musician and poet from Málaga. And listen to this coincidence: he was the same guy who added the sixth string to what would later be called the Spanish guitar. This string right here — it's called the ""bordona.""From Spain, the Décima, with its 10 lines, crosses over to America, just like the Spanish guitar, but in contrast to the Décima, the Spanish guitar continues to live today on both sides of the Atlantic. But the Décima, in Spain, its birthplace, disappeared; it died out. It died out about 200 years ago, and yet in Latin America, from Mexico to Chile, all our countries maintain some form of the Décima in our popular traditions.In each place, they've given it a different name, and set it to different music. It has a lot of different names — more than 20 in total on the continent. In Mexico, for example, it's called the ""Son Jarocho,"" ""Canto de mejorana"" in Panama; ""Galerón"" in Venezuela; ""Payada"" in Uruguay and Argentina; ""Repentismo"" in Cuba. In Peru, they call it the Peruvian Décima, because the Décima becomes so integrated into our traditions, that if someone asks, people from each place are completely convinced that the Décima was invented in their country.(Laughter)It's also got a really surprising feature, which is that despite the fact that it developed independently in each of the different countries, it maintains even today, 400 years after its creation, exactly the same rhyme, syllable and line structure — the same structure Vicente Espinel gave it during the Spanish Baroque period. Here's the structure — I'll give you the basic idea and then later you can look online and learn more about it.The Décima is ten lines long; each line has eight syllables. The first line rhymes with the fourth and the fifth; the second line, with the third; the sixth line, with the seventh and the tenth; and the eighth line rhymes with the ninth. It's a bit complicated, to be honest. And me — imagine me, trying to write in Décimas. But it's not as complicated as it seems. Plus, it's amazing that it's survived with the same structure for more than four centuries. It's not that complicated, because it has an impressive musicality to it, a type of musicality that's very hard to describe technically. I prefer that you listen to it. So I'm going to recite a Décima, one of the Décimas that I wrote for this song. I'm going to ask that you concentrate just on the musicality of the rhymes. For those of you with headphones on — I see that some of you are listening to the translation — please take them off for a minute.(English) Take your headphones off, it you have them.(English) Forget about the meaning of the words for a few seconds,(English) and then you'll put them back.(English) Forget about the structure.(Spanish) Forget about the structure.(English) And just ... it's all about the choreography of sound of the Décima.(Spanish) A choreography of sound.(Sings in Spanish) ""There is not one death that does not cause me pain, there are no winners, here’s nothing but suffering and another life blown away. War is a terrible school no matter what the disguise, forgive me for not enlisting under any flag, any daydream is worth more than a sad piece of cloth.""That's a Décima.(English) You can put your headphones back on.(Applause)(English) Thank you.(Applause)I also applaud Vicente Espinel, because here it is 426 years later, and the Décima lives on everywhere in its original state.I wrote three like that one; you just heard the second. I wrote the first one having only recently learned how, and it has some errors in terms of meter, so it's not presentable in its current state. But the one I sang was good, more or less. So: What was it about? What was the meaning behind those lines?I had just returned from doing a concert in Israel, and I was very emotional over a problem that hits really close to home, which is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I'll explain: my dad's family is Jewish, and my mom's family are non-practicing Christians. I was raised in a home where the two traditions lived together more or less in harmony. It wasn't unusual to see my Jewish grandpa dressed as Santa Claus, for example, or to see my non-Jewish grandpa at the synagogue wearing his kippah, at family celebrations, wearing the same expression that I probably had when Sabina told me —(Laughter)that he had some Décima lines for me. For someone raised in that kind of environment, it's especially painful to see the difficulty the opposing parties have in putting themselves in the other side's shoes even for a moment. So that's what I wrote about.I already had the lyrics, I had the form — the Décima — and the content. I needed to write the music. I'll give you some context. I had only recently moved from Uruguay, where I'm from, to Spain. And I was feeling very raw with nostalgia, like many of you here, who are away from home. And I wanted my song to be very, very Uruguayan, the most Uruguayan type of song there is — the milonga. So now, I had been studying the Décima, and after finding out that everyone tried to claim the Décima as their own, that it was invented in their country, it made me wonder: What does it mean when we say the milonga is Uruguayan?The milonga has a rhythmic pattern that we musicians call 3-3-2.(Counts out the beats) One two three, one two three, one two.And it has a characteristic emphasis.(Sings)But this characteristic rhythm pattern comes from Africa. In the ninth century you could find it in the brothels of Persia, and in the thirteenth, in Spain, from where, five centuries later, it would cross over to America with the African slaves. Meanwhile, in the Balkans, it encounters the Roma scale —(Sings)which in part, gives birth to klezmer music, which Ukrainian Jewish immigrants bring to Brooklyn, New York. They sing it in their banquet halls.(Sings ""Hava Nagila"")And their neighbor, an Argentine kid of Italian origin named Astor Piazzolla, hears it, assimilates it and transforms the tango of the second half of the 20th century with his ...(Counts out the beats) One two three, one two three, one two.(Sings ""Adios Nonino"")He also played it on his bandoneon, a 19th-century German instrument created for churches that couldn't afford to buy organs, and that ends up, incredibly, in Río de la Plata, forming the very essence of the tango and the milonga, in the very same way another instrument just as important as the bandoneon did: the Spanish guitar.(Applause)To which, by the way, Vicente Espinel, in the 16th century, added a sixth string. It's amazing how all these things are coming full circle.What have I learned in these 15 years since the song was born from going all over the world with four lines written on a coaster from a bar in Madrid? That Décimas, the milonga, songs, people — the closer you get to them, the more complex their identity becomes, and the more nuances and details appear. I learned that identity is infinitely dense, like an infinite series of real numbers, and that even if you get very close and zoom in, it never ends.Before I sing you a song and say goodbye, allow me to tell you one last story. Not long ago, we were in Mexico after a concert. And since the concert promoters know me, they knew I was a Décima freak and that everywhere I go I ask about it, insisting on hearing Décima artists. So they organized a son jarocho show for me at their house. If you recall, the son jarocho is one of the styles of music that uses Décimas in its verses.When these amazing musicians finished playing what is for me, something amazing, which is the son jarocho, they finished playing and were ... I went up to greet them, really excited, getting ready to thank them for their gift of music, and this young kid says to me — and he says it with the best of intentions — he says, ""We're very proud, sir, to be keeping alive the purest origins of our Mexican identity."" And to tell you the truth, I didn't really know what to say.(Laughter)I stood there looking at him. I gave him a hug and left, but ...(Laughter)But he was right, too, though. Right? In reality, the Décima is its origin, but at the same time, just like in the milonga and in the Décima, are the roots of many more cultures from all over the place, like he said.Later, when I got back to the hotel, I thought about it for a while. And I thought: things only look pure if you look at them from far away. It's very important to know about our roots, to know where we come from, to understand our history. But at the same time, as important as knowing where we're from, is understanding that deep down, we're all from nowhere and a little bit from everywhere.Thank you very much.(Applause)This is ""The milonga of the Jewish Moor.""(Music)(Sings)For every wall a lament in Jerusalem the goldenand 100 wasted lives for every commandment.I am dust in your wind and although I bleed through your wound,and every beloved stone has my deepest affection,there is not a stone in the world worth more than a human life.I am a Jewish Moor who lives among ChristiansI don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are.I don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are.There is not one death that does not cause me pain, there are no winnersthere's nothing but suffering and another life blown away.War is a terrible school no matter what the disguise,forgive me for not enlisting under any flag,any daydream is worth more than a sad piece of cloth.I am a Jewish Moor who lives among ChristiansI don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are.I don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are.And nobody has my permission for killing in my name,a man is but a man and if there is a God, this was his wish,the very ground I tread will live on, once I am goneon my way to oblivion, and all doctrines will suffer the same fate,and there is not one nation that has not proclaimed itselfthe chosen people.I am a Jewish Moor who lives among ChristiansI don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are.I don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are.I am a Jewish Moor who lives among Christians(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/jorge_drexler_poetry_music_and_identity

But in the last decade, we've become known as much for the elaborate music videos, like the one we just saw, as for the songs they accompany. So we will play along with another one of those in a few minutes, but in the meantime, we want to address this question that we get asked all the time but we've really never come up with an adequate answer for it, and that is, how do we think of those ideas?The videos are not all Rube Goldberg machines, by the way. Last year we did a dance in zero gravity, and once we set up an obstacle course out of thousands of musical instruments in the desert, and then played them by stunt driving a car through them.(Laughter)For one of the videos, we choreographed hundreds of people with umbrellas in an abandoned parking lot outside Tokyo, and then filmed them from a drone a half a mile in the air.So it's all of these ideas that people are curious about, and the reason we've had so much trouble describing how we think of these ideas is that it doesn't really feel like we think of them at all. It feels like we find them. And by way of explanation — well, I have a compulsive habit. I play parallax and perspective games with my eyes pretty much all the time, and it's something I've been doing since I was a teenager. And I think the big contributing factor may have been that this is how I decorated my high school bedroom.(Laughter)And being a teenager, what I did in there, of course, was just talk on the phone for staggering amounts of time. So I was in this visual maelstrom just pretty much usually sitting in one place, and I guess just the overload in general — my brain kind of tried to make sense of it, and I would — If I could move my head off to one side a little bit, the edge of the desk would line up just perfectly with that poster on the opposite wall; or if I put my thumb out, I could close first my left eye and then my right, and my thumb would bounce back and forth between Jimi Hendrix's left eye and his right.(Laughter)It was not a conscious thing, of course, this is just kind of the equivalent of doodling while you're talking, and it's still something I do all the time. This is my wife, Kristin —(Applause)Yeah! Woo!And it's not uncommon that we are out at dinner, and in the middle of a great conversation she'll just stop mid-sentence, and when she stops is when I realize that I'm the one who's acting weird because I'm like bobbing and weaving. And what I'm trying to do is get that ficus back there to stick out of her head like a ponytail.(Laughter)The point of telling you all this is that — for me this is what it feels like to have an idea. It's like they're made of these disparate parts, these disparate chunks sort of floating out there. And if you're receptive and you're observant, and crucially, if you're in exactly the right place, you can get them to just line up.So if you get used to — if it's your job to think of ideas this way, they'll start beckoning to you the way that Jimi's eyes beckoned from that poster, or the ficus beckons from behind Kristin's head. Writing music feels like that process just over and over again, like you've got a bunch of sounds or a groove or a chord progression and you're just looking for that thing on the other side, that little chunk over there, that puzzle piece that clicks right in. And when it does click, it doesn't feel like you thought up that puzzle piece, it feels like you found it — like it was a set of relationships that you unlocked.But with the videos in particular, we're usually looking for this specific feeling which is wonder. And there's always a component of surprise to wonder, so we're not just looking for good ideas, we're looking for good ideas that surprise us in some way. And this causes something of a problem, because ... the process that we all use to make stuff, it actually has a very strong bias against surprising ideas.The process I'm talking about is the one you all know — we all do it all the time. You think of an idea. You just sit and think of your brilliant idea and then you come up with a plan for how you're going to make that idea happen. And then with that plan in mind, you go back and double-check your original idea and maybe revise it, and then bouncing back and forth between the idea and the plan, the plan and the idea, eventually you come up with a truly great plan. And then once you have that, and only then, do you go out and you execute. And this is like — this is sort of a flawless system in terms of maximizing your resources, because this — super cheap. Thinking usually costs very little, but this is really expensive most of the time, so by the time you get there, you want to make sure you're super prepared and you can squeeze every last drop out of what you've got.But there are problems with this, and math will help us reveal the biggest one. Go back to that video that we just showed you. That Rube Goldberg machine, it had about 130 interactions in it. That was 130 things that we had to have go according to our plan. So let's assume that we want to make a new video now, similarly complex — 130 moving parts. If we're really good planners in that system, it seems like maybe we could be good enough to get every part of that system to be 90 percent reliable. 90 percent sounds good, right? Well, it's not. It's terrible actually. The numbers say so. The chance of getting all 130 things to not fail at the same time is .9 for 90 percent to the 130th power. So calculate that out and you get ...(Ding).000001, which is one ten-thousandth of one percent, so your chance for success is literally one in a million.(Whistle)(Laughter)I mean that's not a gamble I want to take, so let's ratchet up that reliability to 99 percent. .99 to the 130th power is ...(Ding).27 — 27 percent. Significantly less daunting — like this might even be usable. But really think about that. How many parts of your lives are 99 percent reliable? And could you really get 130 of them all in one place at once? And if you really could, doesn't it seem like you deserve to succeed? Like that is — that thing is going to work, right? But no, it actually fails three times more often than it succeeds.So the upshot of all this is that if your project is pretty complex — like, you know, every ambitious project is — if you've got a lot of moving parts, you're basically constrained to just reshuffling ideas that have already demonstrably proven that they're 100 percent reliable. So now go back to me sitting with my thumb in the air trying to line up something surprising. If the only things I'm allowed to consider in the first place are ideas that have already been done over and over and over again, I am screwed. However, there are ways around this, because we all know that there are tons of untried ideas still out there, and plenty of them will turn out to be every bit as reliable as we need, it's just that we don't yet know they are reliable when we are at this planning phase.So what we do is we try to identify some place where there might just be a ton of those untried ideas. We try to find a sandbox and then we gamble a whole bunch of our resources on getting in that sandbox and playing.(Laughter)Because we have to trust that it's the process in the sandbox that will reveal to us which ideas are not only surprising, but surprisingly reliable.So some of the sandboxes that we've started videos with. Let's play with optical illusions. Let's try to dance on moving surfaces. Let's try to make toast with a laser cutter. Or let's do something in one of those zero-gravity airplanes. But then instead of actually trying to sit there and think out what that something is, we spent a full third of our budget getting in an actual Vomit Comet and bouncing off the walls for a week.So this may seem to you like testing, but it really isn't, because at this point we don't yet know what our idea is, we don't have a plan to be testing. So we're just — we're just playing, we're just trying everything we can think of, because we need to get this idea space filled up with a chaos like the one in my high school bedroom. Because then, if we can do the bob and weave thing, if we can put our thumbs up and get just a few things to line up —(Ding)chances are no one else has ever made those same things line up before. And when we're done with that project, people will ask us again how we thought of that idea, and we'll be stumped, because from our perspective, it doesn't feel like we thought of it at all, it just feels like we found it.So we'll play another video for you now and the song along with it. This is for the song ""The One Moment,"" and for this one, the sandbox was ballistics and math. So I spent a full month putting together a giant spreadsheet for this. It was like my playspace was 400 lines long and 25 columns wide — which I presume that if anybody is going to understand that, it's this crowd.(Laughter)Nothing is better than a giant spreadsheet, right?(Laughter)Well, thank you everyone, very much. We are OK Go, and this is called ""The One Moment.""(Applause)[The One Moment](Explosions)[What you just saw was real and it took 4.2 seconds](Video) Let me know when it's safe.(Percussion)[Here's the same moment ... slowed down.](Music)(Guitar)(Singing) You're right,there's nothing more lovely,there's nothing more profound than the certainty,than the certainty that all of this will endThat all of this will endSo open your arms to me,open your arms to meAnd this will be the one moment that matters,and this will be the one thing we remember,and this will be the reason to have been here,and this will be the one moment that matters —Oh ...(Guitar)(Singing) So while the mud reclaims our footprints,and while our bones keep looking backat the overgrowth that's swallowing the path —but for the grace of God go we,but for the grace of God go weBut for the grace of time and chance and entropy's cruel hands —So open your arms to me,open your arms to meAnd this will be the one moment that matters,and this will be the one thing we remember,and this will be the reason to have been here,and this will be the one moment that mattersOh ...So won't you stay here with meand we'll build 'til we've blistered our handsSo won't you stay here with me and we'll build us some temples,build us some castles,build us some monumentsand burn them all right down(Music)(Singing) So open your arms to meAnd this will be the one moment that matters,and this will be the reason to have been here,and this will be the one thing we remember,and this will be the one moment that mattersSo won't you stay here with me,we'll build 'til we blister our handsAnd this will be the one moment that matters —So won't you stay here with me and build us some temples —This will be the one moment that matters —Build us some temples —The one moment that matters —Build us some monuments —The one moment that mattersBuild us some temples —The one moment that matters.Build us some monuments —The one moment that matters, oh(Guitar)(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/ok_go_how_to_find_a_wonderful_idea

And this next song, well, I do a lot of historical music, starting with the Carolina Chocolate Drops and continuing on in my solo endeavors. And I believe that knowing your history as a musician is super important — it's important as a person, it's important as a country, it's important as a people.So I read a lot about where the music comes from and where this country comes from. I've been reading a lot about the Civil War and about slavery. And it's really tough. You know? It's really tough reading. And so as an artist, what I do with all that emotion, reading these people's stories, not just, ""Oh, slavery was terrible."" Yes, it was. But it's reading individual narratives of how it was for these people. You know? Then it's like, ""Yeah, that could've been me."" And it is people now. You know? So what you do with all that emotion is you've got to do something with it. As an artist, I write. So I wrote a song based on some of those narratives that I read, and it's called, ""Come Love Come."" We're going to do it for you now.(Claps)(Sings) Come love come, the road lies low, the way is long and hard, I know. Come love come, the road lies free, I'll wait for you in Tennessee.(Music)(Sings) When I was four, my loving mam was cornered by the boss's man. She turned her head and got struck down, they buried her in the cold, cold ground.Come love come, the road lies low, the way is long and hard, I know. Come love come, the road lies free, I'll wait for you in Tennessee.(Music)When I was 12, my father dear was strong of arm and free of fear until the day he raised his hand, then he was sold to Alabama.Come love come, the road lies low, the way is long and hard, I know. Come love come, the road lies free, I'll wait for you in Tennessee.(Music)When I was 16, found my bloom and found my man, we jumped the broom. We pledged each other the rest of our lives and on Saturday nights we were man and wife.Come love come, the road lies low, the way is long and hard, I know. Come love come, the road lies free, I'll wait for you in Tennessee.(Music)When I was 18, bugles called and boys in blue came o'er the wall. I took my chance and followed free, they led the way to Tennessee.Come love come, the road lies low, the way is long and hard, I know. Come love come, the road lies free, I'll wait for you in Tennessee.(Music)Now here I sit in a tiny shack with 13 others at my back. I've sent you word, so all I can do is wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for you.Come love come, the road lies low, the way is long and hard, I know. Come love come, the road lies free, I'll wait for you in Tennessee.Come love come, the road lies low, the way is long and hard, I know. Come love come, the road lies free, I'll wait for you in Tennessee.Oh, oh, oh. Whoa ... oh I'll wait for you.I'll wait for you. I'll wait for you I'll wait for you.(Applause)Thank you.So, with the dark you have to have the light. And in the African-American community, it's been the work of many hundreds of years to find a way to lift ourselves up. So I'm going to end with a couple of tunes from Sister Rosetta Tharpe, one of the more influential American music figures that most of you probably never heard of. If you have, I'm so happy. She's one of the innovators of rock 'n' roll guitar, and one of the first crossover artists from gospel to secular. She's an incredibly important figure, and I'm going to talk about her whenever I can. So these are a couple of her tunes. And don't worry — you're going to get your chance to sing.(Music)(Sings) Look down, look down that lonesome road before you travel on.Look up, look up and greet your maker, for Gabriel blows his horn.Weary totin' such a load, goin' down that lonesome road.

"The philosopher Plato once said, ""Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything."" Music has always been a big part of my life. To create and to perform music connects you to people countries and lifetimes away. It connects you to the people you're playing with, to your audience and to yourself. When I'm happy, when I'm sad, when I'm bored, when I'm stressed, I listen to and I create music.When I was younger, I played piano; later, I took up guitar. And as I started high school, music became a part of my identity. I was in every band, I was involved with every musical fine arts event. Music surrounded me. It made me who I was, and it gave me a place to belong.Now, I've always had this thing with rhythms. I remember being young, I would walk down the hallways of my school and I would tap rhythms to myself on my leg with my hands, or tapping my teeth. It was a nervous habit, and I was always nervous. I think I liked the repetition of the rhythm — it was calming.Then in high school, I started music theory, and it was the best class I've ever taken. We were learning about music — things I didn't know, like theory and history. It was a class where we basically just listened to a song, talked about what it meant to us and analyzed it, and figured out what made it tick. Every Wednesday, we did something called ""rhythmic dictation,"" and I was pretty good at it. Our teacher would give us an amount of measures and a time signature, and then he would speak a rhythm to us and we would have to write it down with the proper rests and notes. Like this: ta ta tuck-a tuck-a ta, ta tuck-a-tuck-a-tuck-a, tuck-a. And I loved it. The simplicity of the rhythm — a basic two- to four- measure line — and yet each of them almost told a story, like they had so much potential, and all you had to do was add a melody.(Guitar)Rhythms set a foundation for melodies and harmonies to play on top of. It gives structure and stability. Now, music has these parts — rhythm, melody and harmony — just like our lives. Where music has rhythm, we have routines and habits — things that help us to remember what to do and to stay on track, and to just keep going. And you may not notice it, but it's always there.(Guitar)And it may seem simple, it may seem dull by itself, but it gives tempo and heartbeat. And then things in your life add on to it, giving texture — that's your friends and your family, and anything that creates a harmonic structure in your life and in your song, like harmonies, cadences and anything that makes it polyphonic. And they create beautiful chords and patterns.(Guitar)And then there's you. You play on top of everything else, on top of the rhythms and the beat because you're the melody. And things may change and develop, but no matter what we do, we're still the same people. Throughout a song melodies develop, but it's still the same song. No matter what you do, the rhythms are still there: the tempo and the heartbeat ... until I left, and I went to college and everything disappeared.When I first arrived at university, I felt lost. And don't get me wrong — sometimes I loved it and it was great, but other times, I felt like I had been left alone to fend for myself. It's like I had been taken out of my natural environment, and put somewhere new, where the rhythms and the harmonies and the form had gone away, and it was just me —(Guitar)silence and my melody. And even that began to waver, because I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't have any chords to structure myself, or a rhythm or a beat to know the tempo.(Guitar)And then I began to hear all these other sounds.(Guitar)And they were off-time and off-key. And the more I was around them, the more my melody started to sound like theirs. And slowly I began to lose myself, like I was being washed away. But then the next moment —(Guitar)I could hear it. And I could feel it. And it was me. And I was here. And it was different, but not worse off. Just changed a little.Music is my way of coping with the changes in my life. There's a beautiful connection between music and life. It can bind us to reality at the same time it allows us to escape it. Music is something that lives inside of you. You create it and you're created by it. Our lives are not only conducted by music, they're also composed of it.So this may seem like a bit of a stretch, but hear me out: music is a fundamental part of what we are and of everything around us. Now, music is my passion, but physics also used to be an interest of mine. And the more I learned, the more I saw connections between the two — especially regarding string theory. I know this is only one of many theories, but it spoke to me. So, one aspect of string theory, at its simplest form, is this: matter is made up of atoms, which are made up of protons and neutrons and electrons, which are made up of quark. And here's where the string part comes in. This quark is supposedly made up of little coiled strings, and it's the vibrations of these strings that make everything what it is.Michio Kaku once explained this in a lecture called, ""The Universe in a Nutshell,"" where he says, ""String theory is the simple idea that the four forces of the universe — gravity, the electromagnetic force, and the two strong forces — can be viewed as music. The music of tiny little rubber bands."" In this lecture, he goes on to explain physics as the laws of harmony between these strings; chemistry, as the melodies you can play on these strings; and he states that the universe is a ""symphony of strings."" These strings dictate the universe; they make up everything we see and everything we know. They're musical notes, but they make us what we are and they hold us together. So you see, everything is music.(Guitar)When I look at the world, I see music all around us. When I look at myself, I see music. And my life has been defined by music. I found myself through music. Music is everywhere, and it is in everything. And it changes and it builds and it diminishes. But it's always there, supporting us, connecting us to each other and showing us the beauty of the universe.So if you ever feel lost, stop and listen for your song.Thank you.(Applause)","https://www.ted.com/talks/anika_paulson_how_i_found_myself_through_music
